                "Body": "received the following additional information late yesterday from speaker hertzberg s chief of staff regarding direct access in the legislation working its way through the assembly . he relayed the information during an informational hearing that an assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in sacramento . see previous note attached below for more a detailed description of da provisions in the bill : a new print of the bill is likely to be issued today . with respect to da the governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of da in the bill . assembly ds and other market participants lobbied him hard explaining that since the bill covers all costs of bonds and dwr contracts through exit fees there is no reason to suspend da . the governor is resisting hard stating that he wants time for the market to stabilize . so it looks like the governor s plan is to 1 ) have a bill that provides for direct access as of 1 . 1 . 03 and 2 ) have the puc temporarily suspend da from september 1 to 1 . 1 . 03 . we re continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate or significantly shorten the suspension . the bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by august 23 2001 ( yesterday ) will not be responsible for any dwr going forward contracts . the customer will have to pay for any power consumed that dwr purchased on the ious behalf between jan 17 and the date of the switch . the bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and sept 1 be responsible for dwr going forward contracts ( though details of how that would work were not clear ) . the stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the august 23 rd date is to prevent a rush to direct access between now and sept 1 . there are currently no efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to sept 1 . finally the bill apparently will also give self - generation priority over direct access in each open season . the bill would set aside 250 mw of the short position each year for customers to do self gen . if the self gen is not subscribed the mws would go to da . the bill including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues is supposed to be released today . the bill will be heard in the assembly committee on monday afternoon . we continue to work with the business customers to improve the da and self gen provisions . it remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the assembly . the politicians are very reluctant to pass any edison bail out bill and the political pressure not to vote on any bailout is significant and growing . but the governor is working the bill very hard . mirant is actively working against the bill . mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a bailout could lose re - election . mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes . the bill also has to make it through the senate . our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the senate president john burton who said flatly that he s not doing anything . but there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session and the possibility of burton doing a deal is 50 - 50 . with respect to the bill s provisions preventing edison from paying wholesale providers with the dedicated rate component included edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers . edison also said that under the assembly version of the bill edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds . more info to follow as it becomes available . if anyone has any questions don t hesitate to contact me . best jeff - - - - - original message - - - - - from : dasovich jeff sent : wednesday august 22 2001 8 : 08 pm to : [ dasovich jeff ] subject : latest legislative version of direct access - - 08 . 22 . 01 the following is a summary of the direct access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that davis cut with assembly . things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly . i was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the davis and hertzberg s staff and the staff have agreed to amend the da provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers . they also said that favorable provisions with respect to self - gen would also be added to the bill . they said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow . note : in addition to the da provisions the bill also includes provisions that 1 ) explicitly recognize the px credit as part of edison s undercollection and 2 ) permit edison to pay debts associated with the negative px credit . ( the bill does not authorize edison to pay power suppliers however and leaves that portion of edison s debt for edison s management and shareholders to address . ) summary of direct access provisions : the program would begin january 1 2003 . it s unclear what would happen to da between now and january 1 2003 . presumably the decision to suspend or not between now and then would stay with the california puc . 90 days after the effective date of the bill and every",

dynegy inc . said on monday does not foresee any damaging disclosures from enron corp . slammed by news of murky off - balance sheet transactions that could derail its planned takeover of the beleaguered energy trading giant . however dynegy said it can drop its $ 9 billion offer if more bad news emerges or if pending lawsuits against enron lead to more than $ 3 . 5 billion in costs . dynegy also expressed confidence the takeover announced on friday will win u . s . regulatory approval . i really have a good deal of confidence but not an absolute guarantee that we are going to be fine here said dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by enron . watson said dynegy had run the deal through worst - case scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense . investors apparently agreed bidding up dynegy shares $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to close at $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares gained 61 cents to 7 . 1 percent to $ 9 . 24 . the deal valued enron stock at $ 10 . 41 . enron agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems including a u . s . regulatory probe into the off - balance sheet dealings a $ 1 . 2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades . watson has cause for concern about new disclosures from enron which last thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some $ 600 million since 1997 . in a conference call with analysts on monday dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company including annual projected earnings - per - share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next three years . but they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed enron s market value last week to barely one - tenth the almost $ 80 billion it was valued in august 2000 . dynegy doubts huge liabilities to ensure against unpleasant disclosures dynegy wrote so - called material adverse change clauses into the deal allowing it to walk away from enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets . in particular dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against enron - including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune - leads to costs of more than $ 3 . 5 billion . chief financial officer rob doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached even if a very substantial settlement was reached in the stockholder suits . commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from enron was over . i think dynegy is making a big bet that they can successfully clean up the problems that enron has had he said . but ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal he was reassured it could address tough questions - a breath of fresh air after enron s tight - lipped response to investors . some analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that dynegy would be too powerful after merging with enron currently north america s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity . watson said dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators led by the federal energy regulatory commission but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster . we really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in the best interest of the energy industry as well as these two respective companies he said . gas pipeline option break -

                "Body": "at its special meeting today ferc released the results of its eagerly awaited probe into california s summer power crisis concluding that under certain circumstances california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california s seriously flawed market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west . the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000 price abormalities entitled part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power markets is available at the following website : in response ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems and solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also been scheduled for november 9 to discuss the proposed solutions and other remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners supported the order the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements while comms . hebert and massey concurred citing areas where they felt the commission had either over - reached or not gone far enough as discussed below . a final order is expected to be issued by year s end . at the same time the commission warned california consumers of their continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve state issues such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient reserve requirements . highlights of proposed california structural remedy in its order ferc proposed a series of market overhauls including : ( 1 ) eliminating the state s mandatory requirement that the state s investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px and allowing these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks . ( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) in order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market . ( 3 ) establishing independent non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso and px . ( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a temporary $ 150 mwh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150 from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers bidding above $ 150 mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential weekly basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to report monthly information on such bids . the commission s price mitigation measures would remain in effect through december 31 2002 . ( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state s ratepayers and utilities citing insufficient authority to do so but subjecting sellers to potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 2000 until december 21 2002 but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs if ferc finds non - competitive behavior . ( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand response management programs . separately the draft order rejected the iso s request for an extension of its current purchase price cap authority and the px s request for price capping authority . commissioner responses comm . herbert reluctantly concurred noting that his decision may change when a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the buy and sell mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing rather than having the commission prescribe specific remedies . hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap concept if one had to be adopted then the soft cap should increase incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also he would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time but allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto filings . in addition he would not dictate risk management methods preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on their own . finally he advised californians not to be so environmentally focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation capacity . comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission s job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct command and control . she also commended the managers of the iso and px saying that they have performed admirably . however she noted she is awaiting comments on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential reporting requirements . comm . massey concurred but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive approach . he feels that the congress has put its thumb on the scale in the federal power act to protect",

                "Body": "summary of the activities since friday : overall it s 50 - 50 or better that the legislature will finish up the budget and recess until august 20 th without having passed some form of an edison mou . will have a better view of the chances of getting an mou agreed to and passed through both houses by cob monday . in the senate : the edison mou : as previously reported on friday sb 78 - - - the senate s version of the edison mou - - passed out of the full senate and was sent to the full senate . the bill sticks 100 % of suppliers debts with edison s shareholders but pays qfs and other creditors . the authors believe that suppliers can t force edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the px not edison which in their view means that the suppliers can t reach edison . our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective . the bill creates an option to buy the transmission system but rejects the goernor s mou which buys it outright . though there s some uncertainty the bill appears to end direct access . information we have indicates that the assembly does not support and will not pass sb 78 in its current form . enron ( and the marjority of market participants ) opposes 78 . the dunn investigation : dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against enron on saturday . the report recommends that the senate fine us beginning with $ 1 000 the first day and doubling everyday thereafter until enron complies . dunn announced on saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full senate for a vote on saturday . in response our lobbyist in sacramento spoke to a leader of the republican party in the senate ( ross johnson ) and persuaded johson to negotiate the date of the vote with burton and dunn . she was successful - - - johnson went to burton and got him and dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the senate returned from its recess on august 20 th . if the senate returns early it could vote prior to the 20 th but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time . the budget : the senate passed the budget at about 1 am sunday morning . the senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until august 20 th . that leaves the assembly alone in sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the edison mou . the assembly in short leadership within the assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party - - the democrats . the speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue . unable to do a deal the assembly recessed saturday night and has not reconvened . it has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget . the assembly also has not passed its version of an edison mou which it says it intends to do . best information we have right now is that the assembly does not plan to go back into session until tuesday morning . late saturday night the assembly speaker released yet another version of his edison mou ( ab 82 xx ) but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among assembly democrats to pass it . enron - - together with business customers - - opposes the version of 82 xx released on saturday night because it does not adequately ensure direct access . best jef",

to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors . california s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state . despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limited - term capacity payment cera estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 . in addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the earliest . therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage . the road to recovery there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall : * encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now there is still not enough new supply coming on",

standing poor relations with alcan inc . of canada a competitor of alcoa s . while in the opposition campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a $ 1 . 3 b hydroelectric power project . earlier this year bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy - back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border . if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with he will likely do so - to that end look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it . alcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements . in a recent shareholder meeting last week alcoa s management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks - the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the pacific northwest and re - establishing revenue growth . kaiser aluminum with the hiring of harvey perry as the company s new aluminum chief kaiser s long - term aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear . as the only dsi to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with bpa they are still in discussions . if anything new arises we will keep you updated . bc hydro bc government campbell s government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the house bill to approve anwr drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration . some of the communities in northern british columbia such as fort . st . john dawson creek black gold and fort mcmurray have had significant recent population booms and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region . currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from anwr through british columbia . significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska . bc hydro hydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers . due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market - avoiding its traditional subsidy of the jobs for power program and pursuing lucrative cross - border contracts with us firms . at the same time hydro will be moving to slice community programs ( anywhere from $ 6 to $ 8 million ) and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the $ 20 - $ 25 million range . bc hydro whose annual revenues hover typically around $ 300 million is looking at early mini - budget estimates for 2001 to be in the $ 375 million range . its trading subsidiary powerex has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california and it looks like ca will have to take this issue to court . bc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board which is looking more and more likely to be larry bell from campbell s transition team . we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate although we believe he is a vice - president at west coast energy . the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november . in the meantime campbell and gary collins ( the finance minister ) will be calling the shots on hydro s future . keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines neufeld has the official title but his power has been greatly curbed by the premier - the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda . bonneville power administration financial solvency after having a chance to speak with a source close to sen . patty murray s ( d - wa ) office it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide bpa an additional $ 2 billion in borrowing authority ( over the $ 3 . 75 billion of existing authority it already has ) may be scuttled . sen . murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review - the white house the senate appropriations committee omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill . the feeling is that if the $ 2 billion of additional authority would be issued the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare . eight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half . the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september when there is another energy bill conference . obviously now that bush s energy bill has passed the house they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation - we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for",

                "Body": "ted an update on the implementation for ffvols : ( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations ( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas we have found that the historical var calculations are consistently lower over this period by roughly 17 mm . the implied volatilities are much higher at this period anticipating strong winter prices . ( 2 ) at this time the consensus is not to relase the historical implementation into production and the official line to traders will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 25 . ( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology ( which i mentioned last week whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) to atleast capture some implied forward effects . tanya s analysis on a fictitious portfolio indicates higher var numbers but poorer backtesting in comparison to the historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate and seems appropriate in periods such as the current one wherein the historical numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied . ( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols and if the results are deemed satisfactory that will be the production methodology . of course we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a sensible compromise of the different methods . regards navee",
