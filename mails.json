( ene ) .\nsome of their reluctance stems from the fact that the looming deal reported by dow jones newswires has yet to be confirmed by the two houston energy trading companies .\nmore worrisome however is the possibility that enron - already crippled by an equity probe and a restatement of four years of earnings - may have even deeper woes to report .\n unless enron is providing significantly more disclosure to the buyer than to the rest of the world i don t see how a buyer could get comfortable . said an arbitrageur with a new york hedge fund .\nwhat worries takeover traders is the likelihood that any agreement would likely have extensive material adverse change or mac clauses providing plenty of room for dynergy to exit the deal should more problems arise at enron .\n as an investor it s hard for me to own something when i don t know what it is said the arbitrageur of enron . i take some comfort that someone is stepping up the plate but that s not enough for me . \nanother arbitrageur added if it gets announced it s a deal with a lot of issues starting with who bears the risk if enron has a lot of lawsuits because of alleged accounting fraud . \naccording to the wall street journal dynergy will swap nearly 0 . 27 of a share of its stock for each share of enron . also under the deal chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) which owns 26 % of dynergy will make an immediate cash injection of $ 1 . 5 billion into the deal and then add another billion on closing .\nshares of dynergy jumped more than 10 % in heavy trading bolstered by the idea that the company is picking up enron for a steal . its shares traded recently at $ 39 . 61 up $ 3 . 06 a share .\nan acquirer s shares typically fall after a deal has been announced in part because arbitrageurs sell the shares short while going long the target . in this case however arbitrageurs are largely on the sidelines which is perhaps alleviating some of the downside pressure on dynergy .\nenron meanwhile traded about 4 % higher recently swapping hands at $ 8 . 77 a share in heavy volume . the stock was buoyed by the reported bid from dynergy as well as a new credit rating from moody s . the firm downgraded enron s rating a notch to just above speculative not as bad as the junk rating some had feared .\ncopyright ?

"Body":"mike mcdonald and laird dyer are looking at other creditworthy california shorts . some of munis ( roseville palo alto ) are trying to combine the long term purchase with a muni bond issue in order to prepay for the power . the basic structure is that they borrow money from the tax - exempt market ( 6 % ) give the proceeds to the power supplier ( who values the money at 7 % + + ) and they effectively get cheaper power .\nwe have done these deals in the past with nat gas . besides the margin on the commodity we get cash in the door against an obligation to deliver . given our overall cash targets and ca length i have made this a priority . mike mcdonald has been selling the concept during the past six months .\nwe are looking at submitting a notional offer later this week for roseville ( 50 mw - 100 mw np - 15 8 - 10 years ) . the big valuation question relates to ena s bid for $ . generally we have paid over our cost of funds for this cash because it does not show up as debt . in my discussions with joe he thinks our $ bid should be based on alternative markets for off - balance sheet cash which might mean libor plus 50 - 150 bp . this sounds reasonable until i think of the fact that i am being charged 15 % for balance sheet funds . the bid offer for balance sheet cash should not be 7 % xl 5 % .\nif i am using $ 100 mm of balance sheet exposure and i can bring in $ 100 mm of cash shouldn t i be able to net out the difference ?\nany thoughts ?\nregards \nchri\n",

\ni have to blush & say . . .\npersistence and personality .\nof course i always follow the advice with my own little\ndisclaimer : what makes me successful may not work the\nsame for you . . . & your first lesson is to get over\nthe deep - seeded idea that success - of any kind in\nmy opinion - is somehow an unknown unattainable secret .\nclearly it is not . it s not unknown . it s not unattainable .\nit s not years of digging to find the secrets to internet riches .\none thing that gets to me so often in my work as an\ninternet consultant author and internet success\nstrategist is that so many people on the net seem to\nhave this incredibly huge mental block that stands\nbetween themselves and success on the net . it s\nalmost as if they ve been barraged by so many claims\nof what works and what doesn t work and so many\nlong complicated routes to actually succeeding in\ntheir online venture that success is the equivelant of a 100 - foot high brick wall .\nit s not that difficult my friends ! it is not that complicated ! !\nlong - time friend and business associate rick beneteau\nhas a new ebook out called branding you & breaking\nthe bank . get it ! !\nhttp : www . roibot . com bybb . cgi ?

"Body":"received the following additional information late yesterday from speaker hertzberg s chief of staff regarding direct access in the legislation working its way through the assembly . he relayed the information during an informational hearing that an assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in sacramento . see previous note attached below for more a detailed description of da provisions in the bill :\na new print of the bill is likely to be issued today .\nwith respect to da the governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of da in the bill .\nassembly ds and other market participants lobbied him hard explaining that since the bill covers all costs of bonds and dwr contracts through exit fees there is no reason to suspend da .\nthe governor is resisting hard stating that he wants time for the market to stabilize . \nso it looks like the governor s plan is to 1 ) have a bill that provides for direct access as of 1 . 1 . 03 and 2 ) have the puc temporarily suspend da from september 1 to 1 . 1 . 03 .\nwe re continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate or significantly shorten the suspension .\nthe bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by august 23 2001 ( yesterday ) will not be responsible for any dwr going forward contracts . the customer will have to pay for any power consumed that dwr purchased on the ious behalf between jan 17 and the date of the switch .\nthe bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and sept 1 be responsible for dwr going forward contracts ( though details of how that would work were not clear ) .\nthe stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the august 23 rd date is to prevent a rush to direct access between now and sept 1 .\nthere are currently no efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to sept 1 .\nfinally the bill apparently will also give self - generation priority over direct access in each open season . the bill would set aside 250 mw of the short position each year for customers to do self gen . if the self gen is not subscribed the mws would go to da .\nthe bill including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues is supposed to be released today .\nthe bill will be heard in the assembly committee on monday afternoon .\nwe continue to work with the business customers to improve the da and self gen provisions .\nit remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the assembly .\nthe politicians are very reluctant to pass any edison bail out bill and the political pressure not to vote on any bailout is significant and growing . but the governor is working the bill very hard .\nmirant is actively working against the bill .\nmirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a bailout could lose re - election . mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes .\nthe bill also has to make it through the senate . our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the senate president john burton who said flatly that he s not doing anything . but there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session and the possibility of burton doing a deal is 50 - 50 .\nwith respect to the bill s provisions preventing edison from paying wholesale providers with the dedicated rate component included edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers . edison also said that under the assembly version of the bill edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds .\nmore info to follow as it becomes available . if anyone has any questions don t hesitate to contact me .\nbest \njeff\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : dasovich jeff\nsent : wednesday august 22 2001 8 : 08 pm\nto : [ dasovich jeff ]\nsubject : latest legislative version of direct access - - 08 . 22 . 01\nthe following is a summary of the direct access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that davis cut with assembly . things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly .\ni was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the davis and hertzberg s staff and the staff have agreed to amend the da provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers . they also said that favorable provisions with respect to self - gen would also be added to the bill . they said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow .\nnote : in addition to the da provisions the bill also includes provisions that 1 ) explicitly recognize the px credit as part of edison s undercollection and 2 ) permit edison to pay debts associated with the negative px credit . ( the bill does not authorize edison to pay power suppliers however and leaves that portion of edison s debt for edison s management and shareholders to address . )\nsummary of direct access provisions :\nthe program would begin january 1 2003 .\nit s unclear what would happen to da between now and january 1 2003 . presumably the decision to suspend or not between now and then would stay with the california puc .\n90 days after the effective date of the bill and every 6 months thereafter dwr would provide information to the puc showing the net short position .\nevery 6 months the puc would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to da .\n20 kw - and - above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the puc has announced the open season ; under 20 kw customers would have 180 days .\ncustomers who switch to da would be responsible for paying 1 ) the customer s proportionate share of the utility s undercollection and 2 ) the customer s proportionate share of dwr s receivables ( if any ) for power previously delivered by dwr ( but not yet fully paid for by customers ) .\nin addition if the number of customers who elect to choose to go da in the open season exceeds the net short then da customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any dwr stranded contract costs .\nif the number of da customers does not exceed the net short position then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed .\nbest \njef\n",

dynegy inc . said on monday does not foresee any damaging disclosures from enron corp . slammed by news of murky off - balance sheet transactions that could derail its planned takeover of the beleaguered energy trading giant .\nhowever dynegy said it can drop its $ 9 billion offer if more bad news emerges or if pending lawsuits against enron lead to more than $ 3 . 5 billion in costs .\ndynegy also expressed confidence the takeover announced on friday will win u . s . regulatory approval .\n i really have a good deal of confidence but not an absolute guarantee that we are going to be fine here said dynegy chief executive officer chuck watson when pressed about the possibility of further troubling disclosures by enron .\nwatson said dynegy had run the deal through worst - case scenarios and concluded that it made good business sense .\ninvestors apparently agreed bidding up dynegy shares $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to close at $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange . enron shares gained 61 cents to 7 . 1 percent to $ 9 . 24 . the deal valued enron stock at $ 10 . 41 .\nenron agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems including a u . s . regulatory probe into the off - balance sheet dealings a $ 1 . 2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades .\nwatson has cause for concern about new disclosures from enron which last thursday said an internal probe showed its earnings had been overstated by some $ 600 million since 1997 .\nin a conference call with analysts on monday dynegy executives emphasized their confidence in the future of the combined company including annual projected earnings - per - share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent over the next three years .\nbut they also fielded a barrage of questions about how well dynegy has insulated itself against further surprises of the kind that had slashed enron s market value last week to barely one - tenth the almost $ 80 billion it was valued in august 2000 .\ndynegy doubts huge liabilities\nto ensure against unpleasant disclosures dynegy wrote so - called material adverse change clauses into the deal allowing it to walk away from enron if there is serious deterioration of its businesses or assets .\nin particular dynegy can turn its back on the deal if pending litigation against enron - including a stack of lawsuits filed by angry investors who have lost a fortune - leads to costs of more than $ 3 . 5 billion .\nchief financial officer rob doty said it was highly unlikely that this threshold would be reached even if a very substantial settlement was reached in the stockholder suits .\ncommerzbank securities analyst andre meade said he was not yet convinced that the stream of bad news from enron was over .\n i think dynegy is making a big bet that they can successfully clean up the problems that enron has had he said .\nbut ubs warburg analyst jay yannello said after hearing management discuss the deal he was reassured it could address tough questions - a breath of fresh air after enron s tight - lipped response to investors .\nsome analysts have said the deal could be thwarted by regulators because of concerns that dynegy would be too powerful after merging with enron currently north america s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity .\nwatson said dynegy would have to work hard to explain the deal to regulators led by the federal energy regulatory commission but does not doubt it will eventually pass muster .\n we really are confident that up and down the line we are going to be able to convince them that this is really in the best interest of the energy industry as well as these two respective companies he said .\ngas pipeline option break - up fees\ndynegy executives also said there would be no complicated financing arrangements of the kind that triggered enron s downfall and that the new dynegy will be able to keep top enron executives and traders from defecting to rival firms .\nenron officials declined to comment on reports that its banks j . p . morgan and citigroup were considering pumping an extra $ 500 million of capital in to enron .\noil company chevrontexaco inc . a major dynegy stockholder has already agreed to inject $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately to keep it afloat while the merger is completed which dynegy expects to take six to nine months .\nif enron backs out of the deal to accept a higher offer it would have to pay a $ 350 million breakup fee to dyegy .\nand if the deal breaks down for any reason dynegy would be allowed to exercise an option to acquire enron s northern natural gas pipeline subsidiary .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nusa : update 2 -

shares of enron corp . climbed higher on monday on investor enthusiasm over last week s $ 9 billion bid by rival energy trader dynegy inc . to take over the beleaguered energy giant .\ndynegy gained $ 5 . 55 or 14 . 3 percent to $ 44 . 31 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange while shares of enron rose 69 cents or 8 percent to $ 9 . 32 . the takeover announced friday halted a free - fall in enron s stock that lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month .\nhowever enron s stock was trading well below the value of dynegy s offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for each enron share which translates into $ 11 . 94 per share . analysts said this likely reflected doubts in some investors minds as to whether the deal which includes escape clauses for dynegy will go through .\nsome industry analysts said they were impressed by the upfront details offered by dynegy during a conference call with analysts an about - face compared with calls with enron . a lack of transparency from enron about its off - balance sheet transactions along with a u . s . regulatory investigation had sparked widespread investor unease .\n i would say that after listening to the conference call i am even more comfortable with my initial judgment that the projections are conservative said jay yannello an analyst with ubs warburg .\nearlier yannello reiterated a strong buy on dynegy saying while the brokerage does not underestimate the enormous challenge at hand the takeover should yield the biggest and most credible energy merchant in the world . dynegy is about one - fifth the size of enron when measured by revenues .\nenron s woes came to light in mid - october after the biggest energy trader in north america disclosed that some of its off - balance sheet partners contributed to a $ 1 billion charge and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity .\nthe takeover is an attractive transaction because of enron s trading operations which combined with dynegy s above - board culture based on teamwork strict values and honesty should yield a formidable company yannello said .\n as dynegy continues to do due diligence we continue to be comfortable with the fact that if there was another shoe to drop they have more than adequate protection in this arrangement to either absorb the impact of that event or to get out of the deal in the worst case scenario . he said .\n we view the both the near and long - term upside potential of this deal as staggering he added .\nlow risks high rewards\nhowever last week some antitrust lawyers said the deal will be closely examined by the federal trade commission because of the combined company s market share in energy trading said steve newborn formerly in charge of ftc merger enforcement .\non monday ratings agency fitch downgraded the ratings of marlin and osprey two enron s off - balance sheet partnerships covering about $ 3 . 3 billion in senior secured notes on a deterioration of enron s credit profile .\n we lowered our ratings to be consistent with actions we have taken on enron said fitch credit analyst ralph pellecchia who added he is not aware of any material impact the moves could have on enron . the downgrade was expected .\ngordon howald an analyst at credit lyonnaise securities also said he is favorably disposed toward the takeover which he called a low risk - high reward proposition . \nthe most critical component is the immediate $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco into enron will bolster enron and help keep it viable .\n it appears . . . that dynegy has enough out clauses to at least protect itself if it decides not to pursue this transaction in the future said howald .\nhowever howald said he is not convinced this is an offensive move by dynegy but rather a defensive to move to protect itself and the industry from a potential enron bankruptcy .\nbut even if it is defensive dynegy walks away from the deal with the rights to enron s northern natural gas pipeline which produced about about half of enron s pipeline earnings and $ 350 million in cash he said .\ndoubts persist\nsome analysts are less sanguine . they said dynegy is making a big bet that it can successfully clean up enron s balance sheet problems as well as integrate its trading and marketing business without losing a lot of key traders and volumes .\n enron s principal - and most valuable asset - is its traders . and those people are mobile said andre mead an analyst at commerzbank who said that he expects a six - to nine - month period of uncertainty in which both companies could lose their key trading personnel .\nmeade also said that enron s restatement of earnings has called into question the quality and sources of its earnings .\n i am not convinced that all the bad news related to those off - balance sheet vehicles are out and all disclosures concerning those entities have been made he said .\n dynegy put some bearish assumptions in there when they decided to bid for enron . but the jury is out enron is a deeply troubled company he said .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\nsome arb traders view enron stock as too risky to buy\nby janet whitman\nof dow jones newswires\n11 12 2001\ndow jones news service\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones 201 -

actually a bit more than\nthat to include losses from three affiliated partnerships .\nand taking a look at how enron shares are trading right now \nthere you see enron continuing to rally picking up another\n99 cents to 9 . 62 . dynegy up sharply - up 5 . 24 to $ 44 even .\nand joining us here in the studio is chuck watson the\nchairman and ceo of dynegy .\nchuck good morning .\nwatson : good morning .\nshepherd : good to see you again .\nwatson : good to see you .\nshepherd : why buy enron ? why buy into what from all\nappearances over the last month has been a mess ?\nwatson : well i think it s important to understand\nthat the mess that everybody is talking about was not in\ntheir core business . the mess is on the partnerships and\nthe litigation surrounding those partnerships . the core\nbusiness has really not been materially impacted . and we\nknew that being in the business and being counterparties to\nenron for some time . so we had a little bit of a\ncompetitive advantage in terms of looking at this because\nwe re in a unique position . i mean we know the people .\nwe re right there in houston . they re right across the\nstreet from us . we know a lot of the people . we didn t\nthink the core business was affected . they have a\ntremendous pipeline operation that s been an outstanding\nleader for years . and they ve got this market trading\norganization in north america and in europe . and what we\nviewed was the core business which we would retain was\nvery sound and pristine and in fact it is and it s the\ninvestments outside - some inside the u . s . and outside of\nthe u . s . that have not been stellar .\nshepherd : i wondered as i ve sat in this very chair\nlast week and reported that enron was restating its\nearnings i wondered out loud whether they were restating as\na result of you going in and - with your team and taking a\nlook at their books ?\nwatson : no that s not true . actually they ve got a\n- had an internal investigation going on for some time \nwhich provided us a lot of comfort as well because we have\nthe benefit of that that had been going on for weeks \nbefore we even got in there . so it had clearly been\nsomething that they were doing on their own . i think\nthey ve been as forthcoming as they can . as soon as they\nknow the facts they ve been reporting them . and we had -\nand we actually wanted to get that information out because\nall that has been you know boiled into the economics of\nthis transaction .\nshepherd : what portions of the business do you expect\nto shed ?\nwatson : well obviously they ve already had about $ 4\nbillion of assets up for sale including portland general \nit s about 3 billion of that .\nshepherd : right .\nwatson : and then most of the international assets \nwe ll take a hard look at . it s not really core to dynegy\nand really to this transaction . but one of the things\nthat we ve done by inserting with the chevron texaco and\nchevron s $ 2 . 5 billion and $ 1 . 5 billion up front with the\nother money that enron s being able to raise that will give\nus some time . we don t have to have a fire sale or\nanything but fundamentally the assets outside the u . s . are\nsomething that were - are not core to our business .\nshepherd : are you satisfied that all of the bad news\nis out ? are you satisfied there s not something they re\nhiding in there that s going to throw a curve at you ?\nwatson : well i ll tell you as i said they ve had\ninternal investigation going on for a while . we ve had some\nof the smartest attorneys we know in there and accountants \nand there s been an awful lot of work done in this . and\neverything that they ve found has been disclosed . we \nobviously don t expect anything else but to protect our\nshareholders of course we ve got some material adverse\nchanges conditions that you know could get us out of the\ntransaction if we do you know find something .\nshepherd : so you can walk away if you see something\nthat .\nwatson : sure .\nshepherd : how tough is it going to be to win\nregulatory approval ? there s a lot of speculation that\nyou re really going to have your hands full convincing\nregulators that this is a doable deal .\nwatson : well you know there s several different\nregulatory groups . but if you think about it the - from an\nasset standpoint their pipeline operation interstate\npipeline operation we don t have one of those so there s\nreally not any overlap of assets . so the discussion really\nwould be around the size of their marketing group and ours .\nbut if you look at the percentage of the market which is\nsomewhat difficult to determine this is going to be a\nformidable competitor but there s a bunch of competitors\nout there . there s a very liquid market . there s no one\ncompany that s ever going to have any particular grasp or\ncontrol of energy markets .\nshepherd : how long do you figure it ll take you to get\nthe deal done ?\nwatson : well we re hoping that about six months \nmaybe nine . but you know we re not taking lightly the\nregulatory approvals that we have . we just think we can\nwork through the issues and hopefully we ll get it done in\nsix to nine months .\nshepherd : all right . chuck watson thanks so much\nfor joining us today .\nwatson : thank you .\nshepherd : we appreciate your time .\nwatson : appreciate it .\ndynegy sees enron rating remaining investment grade ( update 5 )\n2001 -

"From": "kitchen@paris.com",
"Date": "2001-05-21",
"Body":"sources have conducted the following off - the - record interview with a bc hydro executive .\nexecutive summary\n? bc hydro projected capacity\n? bc hydro liberal government s export policy\n? bc hydro expanded capacity projects\nbc hydro capacity\nthe individual stated that bc hydro is convinced it has sufficient capacity to supply british colombia through 2005 even if faced with increasing demand from business expansion . he stated that bc hydro s long - term contracts to supply power to the grid in the western us amounted to only 1 % of bc hydro s capacity . therefore the company likely would continue to be active in the spot market through powerex the company s main revenue generator . for example according to a company report bc hydro benefited from a revenue increase of $ 2 . 876 billion canadian for the first 9 months of fiscal 2001 largely due to spot market trading .\nbc hydro exports\nbc hydro feels the new liberal government likely will make a concerted effort to expand capacity in british colombia . likewise since the liberal government will be business - oriented the bc hydro official expects the government to promote increased exports of power to the us . however the individual cautioned that there would likely be a public relations battle on this point as people don t necessarily favor increasing capacity to produce energy for export . this is due to broad - based environmental opposition to building more plants . therefore in the long - term bc hydro s new projects will favor green alternatives such as dam expansion and biomass thermal and solar plants over gas - fired plants .\nthe spokesman stated that the liberal party intends to go forward with its campaign promise to remove bc hydro s monopoly on power . if and when this happens relations between the company and the government are expected to quickly sour . \nbc hydro capacity projects\nbc hydro is pursuing a number of new projects to expand improve generation capacity including :\n? seven - mile dam - - bc hydro will likely add a 213 mw turbine to the 3 units already in place\n? revelstoke dam - - bc hydro is looking very seriously at adding a 500 mw unit to the 4 units already in place . there is also the potential to add a 5 th 500 mw unit though this is not being considered at this time .\n? site c dam - - a plan for a 960 mw dam was shelved in the 1980 s due to environmental concerns but now appears to once again be a viable option . though bc hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980 s and that resurrecting the plan would be a bc hydro decision .\n? burrard thermal plant - bc hydro has invested $ 250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions .\ncalpine has bought a 240 mw gas - fired co - generation plant called campbell river on vancouver island . this plant is in the final stages of testing and is already generating . calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially in the next few weeks . bc hydro will buy power from the plant for use on vancouver island . this is part of a plan to make vancouver island self - sufficient in electricity . another key plank in this plan is the port alberni plant a 250 mw independently - owned plant that is being sold to bc hydro . the plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply vancouver island \n",

"Body":"at its special meeting today ferc released the results of its eagerly\nawaited probe into california s summer power crisis concluding that under\ncertain circumstances california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and\nunreasonable power rates due to california s seriously flawed market\nstructure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions\nthroughout the west .\nthe ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000\nprice abormalities entitled part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power\nmarkets is available at the following website :\nin response ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural\nchanges to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems and\nsolicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also\nbeen scheduled for november 9 to discuss the proposed solutions and other\nremedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners\nsupported the order the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker\nand comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements while comms . hebert and\nmassey concurred citing areas where they felt the commission had either\n over - reached or not gone far enough as discussed below . a final order is\nexpected to be issued by year s end .\nat the same time the commission warned california consumers of their\ncontinued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve\nstate issues such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day\nahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )\nsiting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient\nreserve requirements .\nhighlights of proposed california structural remedy\nin its order ferc proposed a series of market overhauls including :\n( 1 ) eliminating the state s mandatory requirement that the state s\ninvestor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px and allowing\nthese utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other\nalternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .\n( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their\ntransactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for\nunder - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) in\norder to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .\n( 3 ) establishing independent non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso\nand px .\n( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a\ntemporary $ 150 mwh soft cap that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150\nfrom setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers\nbidding above $ 150 mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential weekly\nbasis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to\nreport monthly information on such bids . the commission s price mitigation\nmeasures would remain in effect through december 31 2002 .\n( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state s ratepayers and\nutilities citing insufficient authority to do so but subjecting sellers to\npotential refund liability for transactions from october 2 2000 until\ndecember 21 2002 but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs if\nferc finds non - competitive behavior .\n( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand\nresponse management programs .\nseparately the draft order rejected the iso s request for an extension of\nits current purchase price cap authority and the px s request for price\ncapping authority .\ncommissioner responses\ncomm . herbert reluctantly concurred noting that his decision may change when\na final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at\nthe november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the\norder address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california\nmarkets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the\n buy and sell mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long\nlist of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing rather than having the\ncommission prescribe specific remedies .\nhebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the soft cap \nconcept if one had to be adopted then the soft cap should increase\nincrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he\nbelieves that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in\nfacilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive\nfor california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also he\nwould not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time but\nallow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto\nfilings . in addition he would not dictate risk management methods \npreferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on\ntheir own . finally he advised californians not to be so environmentally\nfocused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation\ncapacity .\ncomm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc\ncannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress\ntowards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission s\njob to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct command and\ncontrol . she also commended the managers of the iso and px saying that\nthey have performed admirably . however she noted she is awaiting comments\non the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential\nreporting requirements .\ncomm . massey concurred but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive\napproach . he feels that the congress has put its thumb on the scale in the\nfederal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to\nbe unreasonable in the future he believes that this order moves in the right\ndirection by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over\nreliance on the spot market lack of demand response the need to\nreconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy sell\nmandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the\n$ 150 mwh soft cap went far enough whether ferc has the legal authority to\nissue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a\ncertain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market\nprice volatility .\nfinally chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order but noted\nthat this is no time to pull punches . he emphasized that the commission\nneeded frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt s warning\nthat competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on\ntrack . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds he\nstated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing\njurisdictional issues he stated that siting problems encountered at the\nstate level are slowing the meandering transition to competition . he feels\nthat the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these\nproblems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather california\nis part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region\nfor reliable energy thus placing the burden on federal action to make things\nwork hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will\nfully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further\nevidence provided by staff s ongoing investigation .\nif you have any questions or comments please call jack cashin at\n202 508 - 5499 \n",

- physical and financial on jan 20 .\n2 ) we need both a dev and a test environment for all systems that support aep and bridgeline in estate . this means that we need a dev environment ( and hw gap addressed ) for unify sitara cpr tagg erms . conversion teams need to coordinate with infrastructure immediately on this issue to make sure we re in synch .\n3 ) unify servers probably can t be owned by new co while running a single license of unify .\n4 ) some systems are using short name instead of duns id as a key for counterparties from global . the global tagg erms unify and sap reps must quickly define the best approach for making global data changes and minimizing hard coded reference id risks .\n5 ) we must clearly define limits of conversion and test scope to hit these potential dates . we must focus on core systems with only core changes required to support day one trading .\n6 ) we can only convert estate over the weekend due to aep bridgeline considerations . the time window will be very small .\ncore conversion team\n1 ) steve stock -

"Body":"summary of the activities since friday :\noverall it s 50 - 50 or better that the legislature will finish up the budget and recess until august 20 th without having passed some form of an edison mou . will have a better view of the chances of getting an mou agreed to and passed through both houses by cob monday .\nin the senate :\nthe edison mou :\nas previously reported on friday sb 78 - - - the senate s version of the edison mou - - passed out of the full senate and was sent to the full senate .\nthe bill sticks 100 % of suppliers debts with edison s shareholders but pays qfs and other creditors .\nthe authors believe that suppliers can t force edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the px not edison which in their view means that the suppliers can t reach edison . our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective .\nthe bill creates an option to buy the transmission system but rejects the goernor s mou which buys it outright .\nthough there s some uncertainty the bill appears to end direct access .\ninformation we have indicates that the assembly does not support and will not pass sb 78 in its current form .\nenron ( and the marjority of market participants ) opposes 78 .\nthe dunn investigation :\ndunn released his report regarding contempt charges against enron on saturday .\nthe report recommends that the senate fine us beginning with $ 1 000 the first day and doubling everyday thereafter until enron complies . \ndunn announced on saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full senate for a vote on saturday .\nin response our lobbyist in sacramento spoke to a leader of the republican party in the senate ( ross johnson ) and persuaded johson to negotiate the date of the vote with burton and dunn .\nshe was successful - - - johnson went to burton and got him and dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the senate returned from its recess on august 20 th .\nif the senate returns early it could vote prior to the 20 th but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time .\nthe budget :\nthe senate passed the budget at about 1 am sunday morning .\nthe senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until august 20 th .\nthat leaves the assembly alone in sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the edison mou .\nthe assembly\nin short leadership within the assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party - - the democrats .\nthe speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue .\nunable to do a deal the assembly recessed saturday night and has not reconvened .\nit has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget .\nthe assembly also has not passed its version of an edison mou which it says it intends to do .\nbest information we have right now is that the assembly does not plan to go back into session until tuesday morning .\nlate saturday night the assembly speaker released yet another version of his edison mou ( ab 82 xx ) but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among assembly democrats to pass it .\nenron - - together with business customers - - opposes the version of 82 xx released on saturday night because it does not adequately ensure direct access .\nbest \njef\n",

"Body":"cera alert : december 13 2000\ntitle : california on the brink\ncera knowledge areas : western energy n . american power n . american gas\ncalifornia on the brink\nthe california stalemate\ncalifornia moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over\ncredit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would\navoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have\ncontributed to the high cost of power incurred by california s utilities the\nroot cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current\ncredit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address\nthe situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be\nfocused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .\nwestern power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this\nsummer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california\nconsumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis \nregulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and\nsignificant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied\nthe requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end\ntheir rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance\nthe costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable\naccumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .\nthe current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the\ngalvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to\naddress the underlying structural problems in the industry . however there is\nno guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective\nsolution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail\nmarkets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain\nmuddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow it is\npossible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail\nto move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will\ninstead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .\nin the six months since california s supply shortfall began plaguing western\nmarkets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .\nrather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market\nenvironment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and\ndemand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for\nthe crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed \nseveral actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by\ndiscouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps repeated\nchanges to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a\nchallenging siting and permitting process .\nmedicine worse than the illness\nseveral years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were\naccompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay\nadequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus\nover the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of\nbandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of\ncalifornia s electric market woes . *\n* challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better\ncoordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power\nplant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone\nhas struck down some key proposed facilities .\n* price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices\nlimit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market especially\nfor developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment\nto more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .\n* repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including\nthe price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new\nplant development .\n* calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange the iso and the\nferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the\ncalifornia markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of\ngaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits\nare a threat to new plant development .\n* facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials\nto verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of\ntheir generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .\ncera s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west\nare not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability\nare affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of\nolder units demand growth and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .\ncalifornia s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of\nfinancial viability and degrade the political environment for developers\nconsidering entering the state .\ndespite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in\nthe state with a special limited - term capacity payment cera estimates that\ndemand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .\nin addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a\nsufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the\nearliest . therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of\ncapacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk\nof an outage .\nthe road to recovery\nthere are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity\nshortfall :\n* encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a\nseries of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal\nsome have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these\nactions can only be measured by the build itself . for now there is still not\nenough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?\n* stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will\nultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the\ncredit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new\nbuild .\n* move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the\npressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence\n( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in\nthe state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with\nthe market at a peak however now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move\ntoward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a\nseries of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if\nthey end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect\nof knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient\njustification for recovering the cost of these commitments .\n* encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although\noriginally a feature of california s market design most consumers are\ninsulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing\ncustomers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a\ndemand response .\n* encourage market mechanisms that dampen the boom bust characteristic of\nthe market . whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement \nor a minimum term portfolio requirement the california power market needs to\nmove to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the\nmarket is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to\nelicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )\nfuture price volatility .\n* avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to\nbe restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable\nto encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term\ncontractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the\nmarket structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since\njuly - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to\ndo its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its\ncourse .\n* allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a\nmore balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply\nshortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to\nemissions restrictions .\n* free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa\npower plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from\noperating to generate only power .\n* * end * *\nthis cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .\nthis electronic message and attachments if any contain information\nfrom cambridge energy research associates inc .

mail ) sandra moseley ( e - mail ) subject : re : legislative report ( 07 20 2001 )\ndear all \nattached is this week s legislative report .\nthis entire week has been focused on devising a solution for the energy\ncrisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget . although\nthe democratic leadership of the assembly and the governor successfully\nlobbied four assembly republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the\nbudget on monday the four republicans have refused to vote for five crucial\n trailer bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill . there are\napproximately 18 trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budget\nbill but 5 have raised concerns for the republicans : sb 767 transportation\nfunding shift sb 735 elimination of school facility fee housing programs \nsb 1041 omnibus health trailer bill ab 144 public social services and sb\n79 omnibus social services trailer bill . senate president pro tempore john\nburton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the senate\nuntil the trailer bills are approved by the assembly . as of 7 : 00 p . m .\ntonight there is no budget deal .\nmeanwhile on the energy front the four proposals we have been discussing\nall week - - sb 18 xx ( burton ) sb 78 xx ( polanco ) ab 82 xx ( keeley ) and ab\n83 xx ( wright ) - - are still in play legislatively this evening even though\nthe governor told the dow jones newswire earlier today that the proposals\nare not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the assembly\nand senate to stay in session ( despite the scheduled summer break ) until a\nbill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to\nhim for signature :\n* sb 78 xx ( polanco ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001\npassed out of the full senate on friday with 22 ayes and 17 noes . the\noriginally introduced version of sb 78 xx reflected the terms of the original\nmemorandum of understanding ( mou ) negotiated between governor davis and\nsouthern california edison ( edison ) . it was recently amended to reflect\nsenator sher s proposed plan b of the mou - - a version of the mou opposed\nby edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave edison creditworthy .\nit was heard in the senate energy utilities and communications committee on\nwednesday where it failed on a 4 ayes and 3 noes vote . reconsideration was\ngranted however and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 ayes and 2\nnoes on thursday morning . the authors took up amendments such as striking\nthe urgency clause changing the rate component from 125 kws to 500 kws \nplacing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting section 399 . 26\n( which insulated edison international from certain claims ) during the\nthursday hearing . sb 78 xx was then passed out of the senate appropriations\ncommittee on thursday with 7 ayes and 3 noes .\n* sb 18 xx ( burton ) department of water resources : electricity : bond\nfinancing order passed out of the full senate on friday with 35 ayes and 2\nnoes making it possible for dwr to issue bonds at a lower cheaper rate\nthan allotted in ab lx ( keeley ) assuming the assembly concurs and the bill\nis signed by governor davis . the bill also prohibits any additional charges\nsuch as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the legislature and\nrequires certain sunshine provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts\nentered to by the dwr . we understand that j . p . morgan and lehman brothers\n- - the firms working with state treasurer angelides on the bond offering - -\nhave advised the governor s office that sb 18 xx could delay the issuance of\nthe bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons so it is unclear whether\nthis bill will ever be signed . the bill was heard by the senate energy \nutilities and communications committee on thursday where it passed with a 10\nayes and 0 noes vote . it next must be heard in the assembly .\n* ab 82 xx ( keeley ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001\npassed out of assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday\nevening on a 11 ayes and 9 noes vote . it was then heard later the same\nevening by the assembly appropriations committee where it was passed on a\n11 ayes and 6 noes vote . this is the compromise bill we have been\ndiscussing all week authored by speaker hertzberg and assembly member fred\nkeeley . the bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this\nreport with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by\nthe full assembly possibly later this evening . the current version of the\nbill provides for limited direct access state purchase of edison s\ntransmission lines for $ 2 . 4 billion a minimum 30 percent haircut for the\nmajor generators and a trust to cover all claims not dealt with by the\nhaircut option .\n* ab 83 xx ( wright ) alternative electric utility rate stabilization act\nof 2001 was amended into ab 50 xx ( by assembly member bill campbell ) in the\nassembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening and then\npassed out of committee with 11 ayes and 9 noes . it next must be heard by\nthe assembly appropriations committee barring a rule waiver . no such\ncommittee hearing is scheduled at this time . co - authored by assembly\nmembers rod wright keith richman joe canciamilla and bill campbell the\nbill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address\nthe net undercollection among other things .\nother energy - related developments this week include :\n* sb 84 xx ( burton ) state energy resources conservation and development\ncommission passed out of the full senate on friday with 30 ayes and 1 no and\nsent to the assembly . this bill provides $ 10 million from the state general\nfund to the california energy commission ( cec ) to fund a matching grant\nprogram for a battery backup power source for led traffic signals . the grant\nprogram will be administered by the cec in consultation with local\ngovernments and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup\nsystem . it next must be heard in the assembly .\n* the ferc is expected to consider disbanding the current iso board\nfor an independent slate of directors on wednesday the ferc announced on\nfriday . despite a dec 15 2000 ferc order requiring the appointment of an\nindependent governing board for the iso the state has refused to follow the\norder citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of\nthe board . supporters of the ferc order argue that political appointees\nshould not oversee power markets due to the state s domineering role in\npurchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities .\n* sb 85 xx ( burton ) electrical restructuring : rates passed out of the\nfull senate on thursday with 37 ayes and 0 noes . this bill bars the\ncalifornia public utilities commission ( cpuc ) from raising rates back to the\npre - 10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate\nreduction period has expired on march 31 2002 . it next must be heard in\nthe assembly .\n* the senate gave authorization to the senate select committee to\ninvestigate market manipulation on thursday to subpoena top energy company\nexecutives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies \ntrading practices . the resolution - - sr 14 - - passed out with 28 ayes and 6\nnoes .\n* the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted\nunanimously on wednesday to ask the full senate to find texas - based reliant\nenergy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents .\ndespite reliant s having handed over 10 000 documents the committee\nrejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality\nof reliant s documents . the committee stepped back from its contempt vote\nlast week against enron after the company and committee moved closer to\nagreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in texas .\nmirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over\nsubpoenaed documents . the contempt citation against reliant will be\npresented to the full senate and then immediately sent to the rules\ncommittee for another hearing before the full senate acts dunn said .\n* the state s estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped\nfrom $ 8 . 9 billion to $ 6 . 1 billion after a ferc judge ordered a readjustment\nin the state s figure on wednesday . although the state continues to argue\nthat the $ 8 . 9 billion figure is correct ferc judge curtis wagner called the\nfigure baseless and criticized the california delegation for not\nnegotiating in good faith during the recent settlement discussions . the\nnew amount $ 6 . 1 billion does not include power sales to municipal\nutilities and alternative energy suppliers - - two entities that do not fall\nunder the purview of the iso px or the state dwr - - as well as applies ferc\nprice controls imposed june 19 and retroactively takes into account sales\nfrom october 2 onward .\n* ab 28 xx ( migden ) electrical restructuring : oversight board : iso\npassed out of the senate energy utilities and communications committee on\ntuesday to senate appropriations with 7 ayes and 0 noes . it was amended by\nthe author in committee to double - join it to sb 39 xx ( see below ) . this\namendment ties the ultimate fate of ab 28 xx to the fate of ab 39 xx unless\nthe double - joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the\ngovernor for signature assuming the bill gets to the governor .\n* sb 39 xx ( speier ) public utilities failed to pass out of the assembly\nenergy costs and availability committee on tuesday with 7 ayes and 10 noes .\nreconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to\nthe author . given the failure of sb 39 xx in committee ab 28 xx is\neffectively dead as well for the moment ( see discussion of ab 28 xx above . )\nbest regards \ntom mcmorrow and mike martinez\n>\n- iepa legislative report ( 4 ) . do\n",

"Body":"aluminum smelters ( dsi s )\nalcoa aluminum\nthere are no new developments in the alcoa - bc hydro talks to provide the aluminum producer a source of cheap stable energy . alcoa is still shopping around to find a good seller since the load reduction agreement with bpa is still in effect .\nit should be noted that bc s premier gordon campbell has had long - standing poor relations with alcan inc . of canada a competitor of alcoa s . while in the opposition campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a $ 1 . 3 b hydroelectric power project . earlier this year bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy - back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border . if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with he will likely do so - to that end look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it .\nalcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements . in a recent shareholder meeting last week alcoa s management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks - the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the pacific northwest and re - establishing revenue growth .\nkaiser aluminum\nwith the hiring of harvey perry as the company s new aluminum chief kaiser s long - term aluminum strategy still remains somewhat unclear . as the only dsi to not have signed a load curtailment agreement with bpa they are still in discussions . if anything new arises we will keep you updated .\nbc hydro\nbc government\ncampbell s government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the house bill to approve anwr drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration . some of the communities in northern british columbia such as fort . st . john dawson creek black gold and fort mcmurray have had significant recent population booms and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region . currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from anwr through british columbia . significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska .\nbc hydro\nhydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers . due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market - avoiding its traditional subsidy of the jobs for power program and pursuing lucrative cross - border contracts with us firms . at the same time hydro will be moving to slice community programs ( anywhere from $ 6 to $ 8 million ) and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the $ 20 - $ 25 million range . bc hydro whose annual revenues hover typically around $ 300 million is looking at early mini - budget estimates for 2001 to be in the $ 375 million range . its trading subsidiary powerex has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california and it looks like ca will have to take this issue to court .\nbc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board which is looking more and more likely to be larry bell from campbell s transition team . we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate although we believe he is a vice - president at west coast energy . the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november . in the meantime campbell and gary collins ( the finance minister ) will be calling the shots on hydro s future . keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines neufeld has the official title but his power has been greatly curbed by the premier - the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda .\nbonneville power administration\nfinancial solvency\nafter having a chance to speak with a source close to sen . patty murray s ( d - wa ) office it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide bpa an additional $ 2 billion in borrowing authority ( over the $ 3 . 75 billion of existing authority it already has ) may be scuttled . sen . murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review - the white house the senate appropriations committee omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill . the feeling is that if the $ 2 billion of additional authority would be issued the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare .\neight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half . the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september when there is another energy bill conference . obviously now that bush s energy bill has passed the house they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation - we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for anwr drilling .\nspill issues\nthe $ 5 million spill over two columbia river dams a few short weeks after bpa administrator steve wright said there would be no summer spills was very likely a political bone for the environmental groups .\nfish managers notably critfc s bob heinith and odfw s christine mallette had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year . power operators and the corps of engineers questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams and hence suffer higher mortality from predators like the northern pike - minnow .\ndam breaching\ncongressman jim mcdermott ( d - wa ) recently announced that he was introducing a bill that would pave the way for breaching the four lower snake dams . it would also call for another study on the economic effects of breaching and authorize the corps of engineers to partially remove the dams if the secretary of commerce finds it necessary to satisfy esa clean water act or tribal treaty obligations .\n the bush administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the 2000 salmon recovery plan to avoid dam removal mcdermott said in a july 19 press release . if this bill nudges them to take the plan seriously and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams then no one would be happier than i would he said . now is the time to plan for all contingencies . \nco - sponsored by tom petri ( r - wi ) and 19 other representatives - - but no others from the northwest - - the bill will have difficulty getting out of committee where opposition has massed quickly led by butch otter ( r - id ) and doc hastings ( r - wa ) . the two issued dear colleague letters asking fellow members not to support mcdermott s bill .\npacific northwest utilities and energy interests have battled long and hard with salmon environmentalists over the issue with dam breaching . the environmentalists took their lumps earlier this year when energy prices shot up and left them nowhere to run politically . now that energy prices have come down again they will continue to beat their drum over salmon preservation - although they are much weakened now .\nforestry issues\nforest fires\none of the largest forest fires in the pacific northwest the thirty mile fire which claimed the lives of four firefighters is under control this week . the only other major fire in this region currently is the 4 800 - acre union valley fire in southeast washington state . the fire is three and a half miles north of chelan wa and evacuations of residences continue in upper union valley and in washington creek drainage . the fire continues to spread north into washington creek drainage . burnout operations on the northeast flank of the fire were successfully completed . we have not seen any reports of this fire disrupting any electrical lines or significantly hampering transmission \n",

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nwelcome to the expatriate zone\nwelcome to the first issue of the expatriate zone the official\nnewsletter of the new expatriate zone web site . after publishing the\ntemperate zone for the past two years i m taking the opportunity to join\nforces with bob segel who has been publishing the coconut modem with karen\ncoyne since april of 1994 .\nlast year after operating in aol exclusively bob created parrotkey . com \nout on the internet where it would join it s sister site on aol and be\naccessible to all parrot heads . at the time bob expanded pk we had been\nworking on my little area of club st . somewhere and the new\n parrotkey . com seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club .\nwhile we were talking about the direction we wanted to see club st .\nsomewhere and parrot key go we could see that this was the perfect chance\nto as emeril says kick it up a notch . \njimmy buffett s music was a big part of our lives but even more so was the\n expatriate lifestyle he sang about . a lifestyle that includes tropical\ntravel sailing boating parasailing and surfing and yes the music and\nlyrics of mr . james w . buffett .\nso it is that we created our new web site the expatriate zone \n along with this newsletter of that same\nname . in december the expatriate zone opened its doors with its island\ntrading post with its holiday shopping service at the island trading post . \nover 3 600 people visited the site the first day and daily prizes were\nawarded for the first two weeks . the island trading post will open again\nsoon offering a complete line of tropical items not just to those of us\nthat live a few blocks from wal - mart but also for those of us lucky enough\nto be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not we ll start with the\n t - shirt of the month . \nwe want the expatriate zone to not only keep you entertained and informed\nwhile you toil away at your everyday corporate gig but it will also get\nyou ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into the\nexpatriate zone . \nwe hope you all enjoy our new effort and also continue to visit parrot key \nand club st . somewhere . both of which will be closely associated with the\nexpatriate zone and parrotkey . com . \njackson & bob\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n expatriate of the month \njames sunny jim white\nwhen i first ventured on the internet in 1995 i ran in to a guy named sunny\njim who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance\nto connect for which i am truly sorry . but when something is supposed to\nhappen it usually does .\non the first leg of my road dawg tour\n( click on road dawg ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and\ntheir wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house alex\nand i listened to a lot of music and one of the guys we both liked was\n sunny jim . i bought one of james cds from alex and fell in love with it\nimmediately . the cd was his second called life in the laid back lane . \nlittle did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady shady floyd \nseveral times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real\ntour of the us since he moved down island almost twelve years ago . we got\nseveral chances to talk over the summer and we will have an in depth article\nabout this expatriate soon on the expatriate zone web site . be sure to\nwatch for it .\nin the meantime here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great\nmusician . when i asked him about his expatriate status his reply was \n technically an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country \nfor whatever reason . for some it s legal reasons others just because they\nwant to or that s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly\ntwelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience \nfrom climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing to sailing scuba diving \nhot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying\npalms . \neven as james is about to repatriate himself and his family i ask if there\nwere any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? maybe\nsomewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within\nsailing distance of one another was the advice he gave .\nuntil we can learn more of sunny jim s world stop by his web site at\nand if you don t have one of his cds including his\nlatest release sandbar serenade for goodness sake pick one up . you can\nalso read a great interview alex conducted with james at\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\ntravel into the zone \n some are running from the irs \nwe strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens\nand out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one\nour most useful tools of communication computers ? heck no ! with laptops \ncell phones and gps systems we can go anywhere and still stay in touch if\nwe feel the need . but get real and throw that pager away as soon as you can .\nwe hope to keep this section current and informative hopefully hearing from\nthose of you already living your lives in the zone helping the rest of us\nprepare for our getaway from the cities . i m sure there are some of us that\nare preparing to disappear to places like costa rica where the the\nexpatriate zone will become an important tool .\nhow would you like to check out a place to disappear to and write it off\nyour taxes at the same time ? want to go down into the zone to places like\nthe bahamas belize st . croix puerto rico bonaire the dominica republic\nor saba ? want to do something for the planet work with dolphins save a\ncoral reef or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ?\nwell we have the answer . check out these organization s web sites and then\nget some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations .\ndepending on the tax bracket you re in uncle sam could end up paying for up\nto half the trip .\nthe oceanic society\nearthwatch institute\nreef the reef environmental education foundation\nafter that all that s left is to make that plane reservation and remember \n no plane on sunday . \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n jimmydotcom \nafter many delays jimmydotcom has finally gone to the printer with a due\ndate of the middle of april . i hit some bumps in the road on my way to\npublishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena but it was\nall worth it .\nthis book isn t about jimmy buffett it s about the effect of the internet on\nparrot heads . for more information visit . we\nhave a complete outline of the book reviews from other parrot heads and\nsamples of the pages on the site .\nfinancial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 000 copies at\nthe present time so if your even thinking of buying a book i suggest you\nreserve your copy by putting your name on the reservation list . you will be\nunder no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial\npartners ( who aren t parrot heads ) just how many books we need to print . do\nit right away because pre - sales were brisk and if enough of you reserve a\ncopy i can get the financing to expand the first printing .\nlet s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big\nsuccess . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer i had many people tell me\nthey wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss\nto understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .\nmaybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends that\njust don t get it . \nhere s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson founder &\npresident of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with\nthis club on the road dawg tour and shared an advance copy with his club :\n when we received jackson s plea for pictures our members were blown away .\nwe hustled up a package of pix as did a majority of the parrot head clubs\nfrom around the globe and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this\ncollection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is\nyour key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom cause this book is packed\nwith those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! \nbobrob sandlapper phc\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nclub trini update\nspeaking of expatriates how about the guys who play the true music of the\nzone ? club trini s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this\napril one year after it s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert\npretty busy so it s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third\nin the margaritaville cafe - late nite series . i can t wait to hear it as\nmy wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was\nrecorded .\nyou can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini s\nrevamped web site at . along with the great songs we ve\nbecome accustomed to are a few i m pretty excited about . if you haven t\nheard ct s version of african friend you re in for a real treat . along with\nthat is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this\npast summer cario and bob marley s no woman no cry . \nat the new web site fans can now order their favorite club trini cds using\ntheir credit cards . so there s no excuse to not owning everything available .\ni think a true expatriate musical library is incomplete without club trini .\nthis summer helen hiatt jimmy and the coral reefer s wardrobe designer \ncame up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the ice cream\nvendor shirt which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok \npete sometimes forgets his and when he does have it on it lost it s sleeves\nsomewhere along the way . there s a great design that has been applied to a\nt - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\njesters and friends\nnote card series\ntro - pics has just released their first note cards\nseries from their jesters and friends original oils . friends places and\nmusicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and\nexpatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times\nwhen an email just isn t personal enough .\nthe original artwork is also on sale at this site so be sure to stop by and\nvisit them . included in the jesters series are our good friends tim glancey\nand wally nickel .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nmillennium change bubba style\ni ve got to tell you i wasn t buying into this new millennium thing one\nbit . in fact i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year s eve\nshow . nothing to do with jimmy but i just didn t get the whole hype . but at\nthe last minute i had a change of heart .\nand now after being a special guest at seagram s party honoring the new\nmargaritaville tequila i m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded\ntogether for me making the millennium change over very special .\nif you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both visit our\nnew the expatriate zone web site at and go to\nthe web version of this newsletter .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nflash ! ! ! expatriated phans spotted south of the border\nafter making both of tropo travel s previous trips down to cobo san lucas \nmexico i had to miss this year s trek due to my being with the beach house\non the moon tour on it s florida new orleans and houston swing .\nas the story goes those bad boys and girls from the expatriated phan club \nshowed up again mainly for the t - shirts that\nsaid too much tequila . . . or not quite enough on the back . who are those\npeople anyway ? whenever i go to their web site all of them have black bars\ncovering their eyes . if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for\n down to the banana republics -

shirts we have some neat shirts available at\nthe island store . they re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this\nyear s trip except they have tropo travel s seaplane on the back and the\n no bad days logo on the front breast . you can see a picture at\n.\n- -

"Body":"no action needed on your part but just in case you hear something through the grapevine here is current situation :\nsummary\n- aep cp & l have economic interests in the brownsville area which are best served if we do not locate our tie in brownsville public utility board s ( bpub s ) service territory and bpub does not obtain the system upgrades which would be justified by our tie .\n- aep is trying to stall our presidential permit application and to coerce us into moving the tie onto their system .\n- bpub sees this as an attack on their interests and is planning to challenge aep .\n- 5 mou s have been signed with customers and discussions are continuing with 12 others who have all been met and have expressed interest .\n- we are optimistic that the pp will be issued and standard ercot treatments will prevail but we will likely be delayed to sometime early next year .\nhistory\n- enron filed presidential permit ( pp ) application\n- cp & l ( owned by aep ) intervened against the application and raised some technical issues\n- doe asked enron and cp & l aep to meet and resolve issues\n- meeting occurred between enron and cp & l aep . general technical solutions were identified with specific solutions to be determined through a sps study .\n- enron drafted a letter outlining the points covered in our meeting with cp & l aep intending to have the letter signed by both of us and forwarded to doe requesting that doe proceed with issuing the pp .\n- ap & l aep refused to sign the letter and are now arguing that an sps scheme is not sufficient for the proposed tie location ( although aep operates under sps elsewhere within ercot they argue that ours is a special case . independent opinion ( and our own ) is that there is little merit to the cp & l aep position ) .\n- aep have told us that if we move the tie to a location west of brownsville ( on aep s proposed line expansion ) that they would drop all opposition .\n- aep cp & l have since approached the ercot board arguing that cost studies should be done on alternate tie locations and the system cost impact thereof .\n- aep cp & l have submitted to the ercot board that enron should be responsible for any costs associated building the tie at anything other than the least - cost ( system perspective ) location .\ncurrent status\n- brownsville ( bpub ) are incensed at aep cp & l s behaviour and are planning the following actions :\n- making submission to ercot that :\n- bpub informed ercot of the project 14 months ago and no further studies or committee reviews by ercot should be necessary .\n- no changes to current ercot procedures should be contemplated and the tie should be viewed as a firm native bpub load\n- bpub lawyer is drafting letter to go to aep demanding that aep honor their previous agreement with bpub to be supportive of bpub projects .\n- bpub ceo engineer and lawyer will visit puc - t next week to make the case that no special arrangements should be made with regard to enron or bpub needing to pick up additional system costs\n- at this point bpub is highly motivated and is striking out with an aggressive representation of their position as there are implications for them which go beyond the current project . furthermore there is little love lost between bpub and aep .\n- although moving to the aep - proposed location would remove aep as an obstacle we would lose the work done to date preparing with bpub and would probably make an enemy of bpub .\n- bob franks ( regulatory ) scott laidlaw ( engineering technical ) and myself are coordinating with bracewell patterson ( regulatory advisors ) on enron s strategy and level of support for bpub \n",

"Body":"ho ho ho we re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !\ni know that this time of year is extremely hectic and that it s tough to think about anything past the holidays but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 and that s what i d like you to think about for a minute .\non the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week we re going to change the date to the following weekend january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .\ni think we all agree that it s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids etc . so brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend and then you can let me know which you prefer .\nthe first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it s a nice place where we d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it s in the country real relaxing but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham eat dinner together at the ranch and spend time with each other . we d meet on saturday and then return on sunday morning just like what we ve done in the past .\nthe second option would be to stay here in houston have dinner together at a nice restaurant and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier but the trade off would be that we wouldn t have as much time together . i ll let you decide .\nemail me back with what would be your preference and of course if you re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn t go your way no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )\nhave a great weekend great golf great fishing great shopping or whatever makes you happy !\nbobb\n",

- short - term corporate ious - - according to a person familiar with the matter with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion . some observers believe the move is a pre - emptive step by enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted . the person also said enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion - dollar credit line .\nenron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong . but when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank said an enron spokesman . in a statement the company s new chief financial officer jeff mcmahon said that by drawing down the bank lines we are making it clear that enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments . \nthe move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday for example enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit .\nsince early last week enron s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer andrew s . fastow who was replaced wednesday .\nthe draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency fitch put enron on review for a possible downgrade while another standard it takes time to sell assets particularly in today s slower economy .\nthe company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings a computerized search of the sec s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco .\nchewco was established in 1997 with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments to buy an interest in enron assets according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn t further specify what assets were purchased and it didn t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper a managing director in enron s global equity markets group according to the document .\nenron which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed didn t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco .\nmr . kopper who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships didn t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco an enron spokesman would say only that michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july .\nthis statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 000 and involves any director or executive officer . by contrast mr . fastow as cfo would have fallen into that category but mr . kopper as managing director of a business unit presumably wouldn t have .\nhowever reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 a related - party transaction involves a material piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors top officers vice presidents in charge of major business units and other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management . \ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company inc . all rights reserved .\ndeals & deal makers : enron officials sell shares amid stock -

rating concerns\nby jathon sapsford and suzanne mcgee\nstaff reporters of the wall street journal\n10 26 2001\nthe wall street journal\ncl 5\n( copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company inc . )\nnew york - - enron corp . s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse .\nnot for long some bond traders say .\nin trading yesterday the houston company s five - year bond a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar down from a bid of 88 late wednesday and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks .\nthat is far less than the 50 % decline in enron s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit that kind of spread is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower .\nenron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday s 82 bid for instance was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds a small percentage of a typical trade .\nfueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles including losses a securities and exchange commission investigation and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer .\n even at these levels there s very little buying interest said harold rivkin a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton n . j .\nin one sign of the ripple effects the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a default swap - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company s troubles earlier during the year .\neven with its woes enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level .\nyet fitch said yesterday it put enron s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade following a similar move by moody s investors service last week . ( standard & poor s a division of mcgraw hill cos . stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to negative citing concerns about the company s financial flexibility . )\nmeanwhile the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels said glenn reynolds an analyst at credit sights inc . an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . they aren t distressed yet but they are headed in that direction . \nif enron s credit ratings fall it would have implications far beyond the company s ability to raise money . for an energy trader a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments .\nenron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber metals bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation s energy and gas markets .\nenron s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating the cheaper it can hedge or offset its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating the cost of this high - margin high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to or derived from that of an underlying security or asset such as a stock bond or commodity .\n even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron s counterparties - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - is going to be examining their exposure to enron and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it mr . reynolds said .\nto be sure enron despite its recent woes remains a strong company credit analysts said . i don t think anyone s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default mr . reynolds said .\n so far our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them said ron barone managing director of standard & poor s utility energy project finance group . no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it s business as usual . \nyet analysts say the arrival of distressed - debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for enron and its management . traders expect enron s new chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon and chairman kenneth lay to make the rounds of wall street next week meeting with rating agencies debt -

- critics would say blindly - - enthusiastic about enron even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits . now enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions which many on wall street still can t figure out .\nin a research note wednesday goldman sachs analyst david fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company . the company s lack of disclosure and transparency he says is a longstanding enron hallmark . \nso is this a stock to avoid in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its u . s . select list which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm s larger but prestigious recommended list of 200 or so favored stocks where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 .\n just because i can t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can t analyze it or ` i can t figure it out says mr . fleischer who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . if that were the case there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn t follow . \nenron s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week .\n every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box says jim chanos principal of kynikos associates in new york who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . it was really a trust - me story when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . \ntrue no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had .\nbut enron stands apart precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ?\nconcerns about the way that enron runs its business aren t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company s various partnership transactions .\nbesides those partnerships enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings .\nthrough it all most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling publicly dismissing questions about the firm s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday of the 17 analysts who following the stock 10 had a strong buy or equivalent rating on the stock according to thomson financial first call . five others rated the stock a buy though not strongly .\nonly prudential securities which downgraded the stock this week has a sell rating on enron .\nthe bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted .\nover the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index s general collapse analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who like goldman s mr . fleischer own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue .\nenron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston enron retained seven co - managers including donaldson lufkin & jenrette lehman brothers and merrill lynch .\n enron is a big company and i don t think you re going to find a firm that hasn t been involved says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer who still rates the stock a strong buy with a $ 40 price target . they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street . \nhe adds we do our analysis every day based on the information we have . are we here strictly to defend companies ? that s ludicrous . we re here to provide information to investors . . . . yes i have the wrong recommendation on the stock . i don t think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed . \nmr . fleischer whose firm also has served as an investment banker to enron calls his holding a meaningful investment that is not small . but he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised . mr . fleischer says his clients are happy to know he has a stake in enron because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is .\nin his research note wednesday mr . fleischer called for complete disclosures of enron s off - balance sheet partnerships . despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company he wrote that he and many other investors historically have given enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings and position as an industry leader .\n there s not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they re going to make their money but every quarter they do he says . it s hard to get inside to know all the transactions but they do deliver . \ncsfb s mr . launer also has been a longtime defender of the company occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about enron in the financial press . on monday he wrote that he expects questions about enron s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue but that he remains confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [ enron ] and an ultimate recovery in the share price . \n i know i m wrong on the stock mr . launer says . but he says that at these prices he isn t ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst -

"Body":"- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com\n[ mailto : djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com ]\nsent : tuesday september 18 2001 10 : 43 pm\nto : 168842 @ mailman . enron . com\nsubject : rahil jafry : transportation as a commodity .\ntransportation as a commodity .\nby bill hensel jr .\n09 10 2001\njoc week\ncopyright ( c ) 2001 . the journal of commerce inc . all rights reserved .\nenron corp . the houston - based energy giant is familiar with commodity\nmarkets . in addition to energy the business for which it is best known \nenron is the world s largest metals trader . the company also understands\ntransportation . it ships products as diverse as coal steel forest\nproducts and project cargo . now enron is proposing to change the face of\nover - the - road trucking and domestic intermodal services by treating\nthem as a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other product .\nthe company s enron freight markets unit promises to help shippers and\ncarriers manage risks associated with fluctuating diesel fuel prices and\nother shipping costs . enron will quote a set rate for dock - to - dock\nmoves and guarantee the service promised in the contract .\nenron freight markets was created in march to develop a market for\nfreight capacity and to buy and sell spot and forward capacity in\ntransportation . as in other futures markets such as soybeans or pork\nbellies a buyer of a contract would have the option of taking delivery\nof the service or closing out his position .\nenron has successfully used similar formulas to create markets in\nenergy . can it do the same with trucking and intermodal freight\ncapacity ? barry par - ker a consultant for bdpl consulting ltd . which\nspecializes in freight economics said it could work but that\ntransportation isn t like other markets . the marketplace needs these\nthings but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to\nthem parker said . i applaud what they are doing but it is an uphill\nbattle . \nenron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of\nwebmodal a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and\nlogistics services for carriers shippers and service providers . the\nformer webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight s 24 - hour\ncustomer service and operations center . this summer enron took another\nstep by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major\ntrucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales\ncontract with a major shipper but declined to identify it .\ndan reck vice president of enron freight markets said the company can\noffer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are\nconsiderably different from any others . what enron freight markets is\ntrying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the\nfreight market reck said .\na key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and\nconditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery\ntimes and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price\ncontracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges spikes in shipping volumes\nand fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only\nbecause it has deep pockets to make the market liquid but also by using\nits technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having\ncustomers sign long - term contracts .\n what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes\nmuch more clean and predictable reck said . so from a carrier s\nperspective they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece\nof their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are\nalso trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and\nconditions . \nenron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural\ngas and electric - power markets and is trying to change the way other\nmarkets such as steel are structured . efm sees transportation as\nanother commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or\nspeculation .\n we are kind of commodity - agnostic reck explained . we don t care what\nthe commodity is we just sell capacity . \nenron s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the\ntrucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte the former\nnational transportation exchange puts buyers and sellers directly\ntogether while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify\nthe most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike\nthe online services enron contracts directly with the party involved\nand does not wait for two to be matched up on its website .\nunder enron s ideal contract damages for non - performance are spelled\nout explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers\nmust be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example \nsuppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a\nshipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not\nprovide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the\ncarrier can find is 70 cents per mile enron pays the difference . the\nsame process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a\ntruck and didn t enron would provide a replacement at a higher price\nand the trucker would have to make up the difference .\nreck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but\nwould evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under\nway to introduce the company to shippers carriers and other\nintermediaries . enron officials say they ve talked with 400 to 500\nshippers since march .\none goal is to persuade an independent group - such as a trucking\nassociation or committee of marketplace participants - to sponsor a\nforum for negotiations which the company believes would add legitimacy .\nin its first contract enron is acting as a carrier since the shipper\nalready was working with a third - party logistics provider . enron\nconsiders itself distinct from 3 pls . it focuses on dock - to - dock moves\nand leaves supply - chain optimization to others . its aim is to allow\nparties to minimize risk for example by giving shippers the ability to\nhedge against the possibility of diesel pass - through fees .\nenron is an extensive user of the internet however and last year\nlaunched enrononline for traders to trade natural gas oil electricity\nand various other commodities online .\nno one expects enron s new freight capacity product to capture immediate\nacceptance . even enron acknowledges that acceptance will be slow . reck\nsaid it will take time to overcome cultural resistance to change in the\nfreight industry and that enron is prepared for that . we have done\nthat in every market we have gotten into reck said . what we find is\nthe economic benefits of doing business this way overpowers resistance\nover time . you have to show what the benefits are . \njocoo 000 .\n( c ) copyright 2001 the journal of commerce inc . all rights reserved .\nhttp : www . joc . com .\nfolder name : rahil jafry\nrelevance score on scale of 100 : 79\nto review or revise your folder visit http : www . djinteractive . com or contact dow jones customer service by e -

"Body":"below is the weekly western issues update sent to tim earlier . if you have any questions please feel free to kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) .\nexecutive summary\nferc multi - party refund negotiations\nbpa financials & smelter agreements\nbc hydro rate freeze\npower refunds\nthe big event that happened last week in washington dc in regards to california and the rest of the western energy markets was that multi - party negotiations that flopped - apparently the difference between $ 8 . 9 billion and $ 703 . 6 million between parties could not be settled . below is a rough breakdown corporate offerings :\nwilliams duke reliant dynegy & mirant : $ 510 million combined\npowerex ( bc hydro ) : $ 125 million\n15 power marketers including enron : $ 49 . 6 million\n7 california municipal utilities : $ 6 . 5 million\nload - serving entities outside ca : $ 12 . 5 million\nnorthwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges however judge curtis wagner has virtually ignored northwest claims of $ 611 million in overcharges stating there was little time to address the issues raised by the pacific northwest parties . they did not have data on what they are owed nor an amount of refunds due them . contrary to the judge s claim a number of northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement conference although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts . wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning against giving nw utilities the same fast - track status as california . ferc had originally not even wanted to consider nw claims in this conference until a group of nw senators got together and applied some pressure - the result was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together . below is another rough breakdown of the claims :\npacificcorp : $ 6 . 7 million\nsnohomish pud : $ 229 million\ntacoma power : $ 71 . 9 million\nseattle city light : $ 222 million\nport of seattle : $ 11 . 1 million\nbpa : $ 70 million *\nbpa\nbpa borrowing : sen . patty murray ( d - wa ) has been leading the fight for bpa s request of $ 2 b in additional borrowing authority and was pleased the senate voted to increase access to additional funds however sen . murray has promised to fight the re - authorization caveat . murray s spokesman said the committee may have been concerned about bumping up against spending caps when it added the mandate for annual re - authorization . bonneville has warned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of 2003 unless the amount was boosted from the current limit of $ 3 . 75 billion - - the increase got through the senate energy & water development subcommittee but had the caveat added when it reached the full appropriations committee . increased borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure retrofit columbia river hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue conservation programs . we can expect to see more action coming out of sen . murray s office .\nrefunds : recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of northwest utilities ( including bpa ) seeking refunds for the overpriced power california is currently fighting . this information seems supported by fears that earlier settlements reached between northwest utilities and california state may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings . if a bankruptcy court were to issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and pg & e ( & potentially bankrupt socal . ed . ) it is possible that bpa could press a refund request in the range of $ 70 m to $ 100 m . however while bpa s refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances they are also careful about voicing their opinion because of the $ 167 million in gross sales they made from california\nbpa administration : the bush administration reportedly has no current plans to replace the bpa s administrator . the entire northwest delegation ( democrats and republicans from the bpa region ) has asked that he be made the full - time administrator . however since many of the decision - makers at doe are conservative republicans they re not comfortable with him because he is a democrat . at this time doe people are unsure of how to handle this matter and appear to be in a state of limbo .\ndsi aluminum smelter - load reduction agreements : bpa is in the hot seat right now realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible for smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for other sources . few believe that these current market prices will be sustainable considering the fact that the west will see a significant supply increase within the next year . consequently dsi s will be very concerned about signing long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on prices ( which are still historically very high but dropping ) . currently there are two northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations . alcoa is in preliminary talks with bc hydro to secure additional power to restart its intalco smelter and kaiser free from the money and the constraints of a load - reduction agreement is also attempting to restart plants . we will continuing monitoring of this situation and will update as the story develops .\nbc hydro\nrate freeze : the current rate freeze was imposed by the former ndp government and it ends 30 september 2001 . it is up to the government to direct the bcuc to lift the rate freeze and before it can do that it has to schedule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back under the bcuc s purview . it has been a number of years since there was a rate hearing and people are not looking forward to it because it begs all sorts of questions about overall energy policy . a rate hearing will be delayed until the new government has completed its administrative core review and decided on a broader energy policy including its goals for bc hydro . lifting the rate freeze partly depends on how much regulators believe should be held in the rate stabilization account - this money has been redirected elsewhere over the past few years leaving the utility unprepared for the sort of low - water conditions that have surfaced this year . bc hydro wants the freeze lifted and the new government will have an ideological bias against continuing the rate freeze given that it was put in place by the ndp and flouts free enterprise principles . this suggests the rate freeze is on the way out but it may persist beyond the original 30 september deadline for the reasons outlined above . how long it persists depends on how long it takes the new government to complete the core review \n",

"Body":"louise and bill \nas you are aware nbc has sent us notification of an event of default under the isda due to our failure to post collateral ( in the form of an lc ) . to date nbc has resisted all of our commercial solutions to this issue . at the close of business today our cure period for the event of default will expire and nbc will be able to draw on the $ 1 . 4 mm lc posted and terminate the contract . today we have seen a bit of movement in their position . they are now willing to accept cash as collateral if enron will agree to reduce its collateral threshold to some agreed upon amount . bill bonnell their credit manager has suggested $ 4 mm as the appropriate level . this would entail enron posting $ 3 mm in addition to the $ 500 k collateral call for a total of $ 3 . 5 mm . i believe we could more than likely negotiate the threshold to $ 5 mm if we are willing to post the cash . a $ 5 mm level would require an additional posting of $ 2 mm which is what we originally forecasted to try to buy down the position exposure . as we must have a resolution today to forestall further action on the part of nbc please advise as to management s willingness to use cash for the purpose of preventing termination of this contract .\nthanks \ntany\n",

it used to blow up our old scheduling systems\n( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new\ndeal and we will have to zero out the old deal .\nbefore you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware -

im east to ena - im\nmarket east - but not from\nena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be\nthe same legal entity .\n warning - not the same legal entity \nalso -

business democrats . with or without the shaver lake provisions hertzberg should get at least 41 democratic members ( and probably a few more ) but no more than 2 republicans ( if any ) to vote aye on the bill . hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass and there are 50 democrats in his caucus . if the vote is close a personal plea from him and or the governor should enable him to get to 41 .\nsenate\nthe bill would next move to the senate for approval of the assembly s amendments . this is where the prognosticating gets difficult . senate president pro tem john burton has said he does not support any amendments to sb 78 xx . gov . davis and speaker hertzberg will likely meet several times with burton to try to cut a deal but relations between davis and burton are currently frayed ( due to a variety of factors ) and burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position .\nthis would lead to one of four scenarios :\n? burton refuses to have the bill heard in the senate and no edison mou bill is approved before sept . 15 th \n? burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition ( this option is unlikely ) \n? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg and brings the bill ( as it is passed by the assembly ) for a vote in the full senate with his support \n? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg but as part of the deal he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the assembly for more amendments and another vote in the assembly - before a vote in the senate .\njohn burton is considered one of the smartest and certainly the cleverest politician in california state government today so it is problematic to guess his next move . additionally external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result . for instance the governor may be willing to cut a deal with burton on an unrelated issue that burton cares more about resolving his way ( e . g . workers compensation benefits drug courts reapportionment ) . foretelling what will happen in the senate is extremely difficult . but davis and hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him and given burton s past actions he may string them along holding out for several days ( maybe even until sept . 14 th ) before he agrees to anything .\ngovernor\nassuming the bill escapes the senate ( and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes ) the governor will almost certainly sign it regardless of edison s public position . the bill will go into effect 90 days after the governor signs it .\nconsumer groups have vowed to undo any edison bailout enacted into law by way of the ballot box . that could be either ( 1 ) an initiative to pass another bill overturning sb 78 xx and replacing it with other provisions or ( 2 ) a referendum to repeal sb 78 xx making it as if the bill was never passed at all .\ninitiative\nonce drafted and submitted to the attorney general it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary and another 25 days if the ag determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary . after either the 15 or 40 days the attorney general sends it to the proponents the senate the assembly and the secretary of state . the day it is mailed is called the summary date . that is the day upon which all calculations are made .\nthe proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures . however the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters . therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election on march 5 2002 ( statewide primaries ) and so could not qualify until the statewide general election on november 5 2002 . however the window is tight for that election as well and a proposal would need to be submitted to the attorney general by the end of september 2001 to qualify for november 2002 .\nthe legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative but cannot amend it . so whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot . an initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for governor in the preceding gubernatorial election ( 419 260 signatures ) . the ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers . it seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly but harvey rosenfield of the foundation for taxpayer & consumer rights has been successful at placing pro - consumer initiatives on the ballot before including prop . 9 in 1998 which sought to undo ab 1890 before the public understood its ramifications .\nreferendum\nreferenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives although a successful referendum was on the march 7 2000 ballot . prior to that the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the june 1982 primary election ballot . all four were defeated . since 1912 there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot . of the 50 attempts 39 qualified for the ballot 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect . the circulation calendar verification timing and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives . for example the california constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred . the signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute though .\npolitical dynamics\nnotwithstanding the governor s and assembly speaker s desire to enact an edison rescue package senate president pro tem john burton is in the driver s seat . in fact as noted above there is a perception among some that it is the governor who needs burton and not the other way around . one business source close to the negotiations believes burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an edison bailout . in fact members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility their reluctance fed by generators lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout .\ncurrently due largely to this dynamic and others such as the shaver lake issue there are not 41 votes for an edison rescue in the assembly . we believe this will change as the governor and the speaker exert their influence and the bill will pass the assembly . as difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the assembly the state senate presents an even larger challenge . however at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an edison rescue package being approved by the state senate are less than 50 percent \n",

"Body":"i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) robert humlicek jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows :\nmost of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however with this amount of people in the area space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers .\nas tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants .\none area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however this number appears correct . also for the most part there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs filing cabinets credenzas etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from .\nthere is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity is open and would accommodate up to 11 .\nif we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule .\nthe floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent .\nthis floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space .\nrobert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers laptops etc . however if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports additional switches can be added .\nin summary the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center .\nrussell s . long\nenron net works llc\nrussell . long @ enron . com\n( 713 ) 345 - 375\n",

"Body":"executive summary :\nthe likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60 % . this is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below but also because the 30 - day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week increasing the likelihood that their ipp creditors will act against them . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly .\n1 . utilities vs . cpuc\ngovernor davis attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed . the case will come before the judge on monday february 12 th . the federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities . however the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ( $ . 01 kwh ) . this will be left to an appellate court . the decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing by the smaller ipps ( as noted in our reports last week ) or by larger out - of - state generators such as duke reliant and dynegy ( as noted in the press this morning ) . this is expected next week or the week after .\n2 . prospects for a bailout\nbill ab 18 x is effectively dead from lack of support .\nsenator burton despite his public refusals is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail - out . the statements by burton and the ca state treasurer are merely a negotiating position . they are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear . for burton this is because of his long association with labor unions ; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy .\nburton has been negotiating with consumer advocate harvey rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him . the deal burton is expected to arrange would be for :\nbonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state but with some kind of state support ( but less than full faith and credit of the state of ca which would not pass ) . this would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills ( e . g . $ . 01 though the actual amount is not known ) . these bonds would be asset - backed securities with payment receivable from rate payers . the term of these bonds is unknown ; if the term is made quite long ( e . g . 20 years ) the associated rate increase could be very small .\nthe state would purchase the utilities transmission assets for a very high price . the amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled .\nif the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) sources believe that this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . as noted in an earlier report the california legislature habitually does not act until things hit the wall . \nit is expected that the republicans in the legislature will follow burton s lead and support the bail - out plan . the assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature . one moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail - out in her central valley district is 50 to 1 . however an involuntary filing ( or the threat thereof ) may be enough to trigger legislative support . it would allow the argument of an imminent threat to the people of the state of california .\n3 . consumer opposition\nharvey rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum . if the referendum fails he intends to attack individual legislators ( though not john burton who reportedly has immunity from rosenfield ) .\nsome legislators are thinking of voting for the bail - out plan then supporting a referendum from rosenfield later . however if the bail - out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill ( rather than put in place by the puc for example ) it cannot be reversed by a referendum . as additional insurance against rosenfield by supporting the bonds issued under the plan the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan . while it is not clear that this is a factual argument it still might impede any referendum \n",

presto kevin m . ; davis mark dana ; may tom ; will lloyd ; lindberg susan ; gupta gautam ; misra narsimha ; scheuer janelle ; baughman edward d . ; herndon rogers\ncc : nicolay christi l .\nsubject : re : rto week - - summary of congestion management panel\nrto week\nday 2 - - october 16 2001\ncongestion management and transmission rights\nthe morning panel discussion was on congestion management . the panelists were : nancy brockway commissioner new hampshire psc ; reem fahey edison mission ; carol guthrie chevron texaco ; shmuel oren university of california - berkley and advises texas puc ; andy ott pjm ; michael schnitzer northbridge group .\ngeneral observations\nthe commissioners were again all present ( wood left mid - morning to give testimony on capitol hill ) . today however ferc staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions . the topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again . this will probably continue for the rest of the week . what i have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energy market based using lmp . very few panelists have opposed this ; at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized - - basically conceding that pjm s system will be implemented in the northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else .\nlocational marginal pricing\nthe panelists all agreed that lmp in the real time market is necessary ( schmuel oren does not oppose it ) . most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across rtos . andy ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized . carol guthrie does not favor standardization and urged ferc to not standardize the pjm system throughout the eastern interconnect . she said ferc should try a couple of different systems and see what works .\nftrs versus flowgates\nthe panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not physical . schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear . most of the panelists including the psc commissioner prefer ftrs rather than flowgates . schmuel is a flowgate advocate . after some discussion the panelists agreed that ftrs and flowgates could work together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood . andy ott said flowgates could work with ftrs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs ( liquidity standard product ) and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point - to - point rights then ftrs and flowgates can coexist . if a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay . however if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling the two cannot coexist . schmuel seemed to agree with this premise although this is not his preference . he seems to prefer only flowgates without ftrs . brockway seems to prefer ftrs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs .\nthe panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from ftrs or flowgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not agreed upon .\nferc staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates . many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstances change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant . schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable .\nthe panelists agreed that these financial rights ( either ftrs or flowgates ) should be tradable in the secondary market . the panelists disagreed on which instrument - - ftrs or flowgates - - are more tradable . andy thinks ftrs are more tradable ; schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable .\noptions versus obligations\nthe panelists discussed the benefits of having ftrs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if ftrs are only options and the ftr holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow . andy ott said options will most likely result in fewer ftrs being allocated . schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front .\nthe afternoon panel was on transmission planning and expansion . steve walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly .\nlet me know if you have any questions .\nsara\n",

( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date january 1999 .\namong es power 3 s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay listed as a director and mcmahon and fastow listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn t immediately returned .\ndemands demands\nrating agencies moody s fitch and s & p recently put enron s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade or junk bonds suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely .\nif enron s rating drops below investment grade it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade .\nfriday the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron s condition .\nthis week a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however in a friday press release ceo lay said that enron was the market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . he added : it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . \nmcmahon reportedly objected to fastow s role in ljm allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he s connected to don t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity .\nunder the radar : enron s flickering bulb\nby christopher edmonds\nspecial to thestreet . com\n10 26 2001 05 : 08 pm edt\nurl :\nwhile the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out it s clearly flickering . to date investors aren t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness .\nwhat s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ve been imagined with any number of ne er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said i never had to worry about enron s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . \npeter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron s adventures for some time . if you d listened to him earlier this year you d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding .\nthe rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are for now just that . and enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis nor is royal dutch shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess his departure appears only indirectly related to enron s current woes .\nnow enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and more importantly its reputation .\nthe company s challenge\nbut what does enron do now ? it s very simple . come clean clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks .\n our gut feel is that enron can pull it off and long - term investors should hold firm as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months says jeff dietert power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . \ndietert outlines four challenges for enron . one management must regain the street s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance -

rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings bbb + from standard & poor s and baal from moody s are three levels above non - investment grade . however both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron s debt -

"Body":"in another surprise move the puc approved an edison bailout today on a 5 - 0 vote . this item was not on the commission s agenda other than as a placeholder regarding litigation . we do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to edison s svp of regulatory affairs and here s a summary :\nthe commission will keep current rates in place through 2003\nany overcollection resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $ 3 . 3 b in edison s past due accounts ( the so - called undercollection )\nif edison collects the $ 3 . 3 b prior to 2003 then rates can change\nif edison has not collected the $ 3 . 3 b by the end of 2003 the puc will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder . half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005 .\nany refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $ 3 . 3 b undercollection .\nedison can keep 10 % of any refunds received after the $ 3 . 3 b is paid off .\nedison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $ 3 . 3 b .\nedison can apply to the puc for approval to hedge gas price risk .\nedison will be protected from any increases in dwr contract costs ( i . e . if dwr s costs go up the puc will raise rates rather than take it out of edison s rates )\nthe puc will not fine edison during this period if edison s capital structure varies from the puc - approved capital structure\nedison must drop its lawsuits against the puc regarding 1 ) the filed rate doctrine and 2 ) the so - called turn accounting method which effectively kept the rate freeze in place .\nedison agrees to cooperate with the attorney general and the puc in all litigation against suppliers .\nthe puc decision could likely nullify the need for the special session that the governor recently announced\nwe will report back with additional details as soon as we get them .\nbest \njeff\n- - - - - original message - - - - -\nfrom : dasovich jeff\nsent : tuesday october 02 2001 2 : 45 pm\nto : kean steven j . ; belden tim ; sharp vicki ; blachman jeremy ; comnes alan ; tribolet michael ; walsh kristin ; delainey david ; leff dan ; frazier lamar ; keeney kevin ; gahn scott ; swain steve ; lavorato john ; kaufman paul ; steffes james d . ; calger christopher f . ; mara susan ; black don ; richter jeff ; kitchen louise ; dietrich janet ; mara susan ; robertson linda ; kingerski harry ; denne karen ; palmer mark a .
