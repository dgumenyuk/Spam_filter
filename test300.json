barry par - ker a consultant for bdpl consulting ltd . which specializes in freight economics said it could work but that transportation isn t like other markets . the marketplace needs these things but transportation marketplaces are not really receptive to them parker said . i applaud what they are doing but it is an uphill battle . enron took a first step up that hill this year with its acquisition of webmodal a firm that provides domestic intermodal technology and logistics services for carriers shippers and service providers . the former webmodal office in chicago houses enron freight s 24 - hour customer service and operations center . this summer enron took another step by acquiring trucking capacity for up to two years with major trucking companies . enron said it recently signed its first firm sales contract with a major shipper but declined to identify it . dan reck vice president of enron freight markets said the company can offer shippers and carriers performance obligation terms that are considerably different from any others . what enron freight markets is trying to do is commercialize the risk management products for the freight market reck said . a key to the service is standardization of general contractual terms and conditions . the standardized areas would include specific delivery times and specific consequences for non - performance . fixed - price contracts act to stabilize fuel surcharges spikes in shipping volumes and fluctuating carrier rates . enron said it can do that not only because it has deep pockets to make the market liquid but also by using its technology to evaluate optimal routing and modes and by having customers sign long - term contracts . what ends up happening is that the obligations of both parties be - comes much more clean and predictable reck said . so from a carrier s perspective they can really count on a revenue stream from this piece of their business . there are very clean operational parameters . we are also trying to have shippers sign on with us under those same terms and conditions . enron has a reputation as an innovator in its approach to the natural gas and electric - power markets and is trying to change the way other markets such as steel are structured . efm sees transportation as another commodity with a price that can be the basis of hedging or speculation . we are kind of commodity - agnostic reck explained . we don t care what the commodity is we just sell capacity . enron s approach differs significantly from others that have entered the trucking field as technology - based intermediaries . nte the former national transportation exchange puts buyers and sellers directly together while logistics . com uses the contracting process to identify the most cost - effective matches between shippers and carriers . unlike the online services enron contracts directly with the party involved and does not wait for two to be matched up on its website . under enron s ideal contract damages for non - performance are spelled out explicitly as part of its belief that for the market to work buyers must be able to bank on the reliability of the contract . for example suppose a carrier has accepted a contract price of $ 1 . 20 per mile for a shipment of freight between atlanta and chicago . if enron does not provide the carrier with a load and the next best alternative the carrier can find is 70 cents per mile enron pays the difference . the same process would work in reverse . if the carrier promised to provide a truck and didn t enron would provide a replacement at a higher price and the trucker would have to make up the difference . reck said the standardized contract would not be dictated by enron but would evolve through negotiations or public forums . efforts are under way to introduce the company to shippers carriers and other intermediaries . enron officials say they ve talked with 400 to 500 shippers since march . one",

                "Body": "below is the weekly western issues update sent to tim earlier . if you have any questions please feel free to kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) . executive summary ferc multi - party refund negotiations bpa financials & smelter agreements bc hydro rate freeze power refunds the big event that happened last week in washington dc in regards to california and the rest of the western energy markets was that multi - party negotiations that flopped - apparently the difference between $ 8 . 9 billion and $ 703 . 6 million between parties could not be settled . below is a rough breakdown corporate offerings : williams duke reliant dynegy & mirant : $ 510 million combined powerex ( bc hydro ) : $ 125 million 15 power marketers including enron : $ 49 . 6 million 7 california municipal utilities : $ 6 . 5 million load - serving entities outside ca : $ 12 . 5 million northwest utilities submitted their calculations of overcharges however judge curtis wagner has virtually ignored northwest claims of $ 611 million in overcharges stating there was little time to address the issues raised by the pacific northwest parties . they did not have data on what they are owed nor an amount of refunds due them . contrary to the judge s claim a number of northwest utilities did submit claim amounts at the settlement conference although the problem is each utility has its own methodology for calculating these amounts . wagner was probably frustrated that there was no standard methodology for these calculations and appears to be leaning against giving nw utilities the same fast - track status as california . ferc had originally not even wanted to consider nw claims in this conference until a group of nw senators got together and applied some pressure - the result was there was not much time to get the overcharge data together . below is another rough breakdown of the claims : pacificcorp : $ 6 . 7 million snohomish pud : $ 229 million tacoma power : $ 71 . 9 million seattle city light : $ 222 million port of seattle : $ 11 . 1 million bpa : $ 70 million * bpa bpa borrowing : sen . patty murray ( d - wa ) has been leading the fight for bpa s request of $ 2 b in additional borrowing authority and was pleased the senate voted to increase access to additional funds however sen . murray has promised to fight the re - authorization caveat . murray s spokesman said the committee may have been concerned about bumping up against spending caps when it added the mandate for annual re - authorization . bonneville has warned it could exhaust its borrowing authority by the end of 2003 unless the amount was boosted from the current limit of $ 3 . 75 billion - - the increase got through the senate energy & water development subcommittee but had the caveat added when it reached the full appropriations committee . increased borrowing authority would be used to update transmission infrastructure retrofit columbia river hydropower projects to boost efficiency and continue conservation programs . we can expect to see more action coming out of sen . murray s office . refunds : recent media reports have hinted to the possibility of northwest utilities ( including bpa ) seeking refunds for the overpriced power california is currently fighting . this information seems supported by fears that earlier settlements reached between northwest utilities and california state may be challenged by bankruptcy proceedings . if a bankruptcy court were to issue a ruling that significantly altered agreements between bpa and pg & e ( & potentially bankrupt socal . ed . ) it is possible that bpa could press a refund request in the range of $ 70 m to $ 100 m . however while bpa s refund request may be an option to stabilize their finances they are also careful about voicing their opinion because of the $ 167 million in gross sales they made from california bpa administration : the bush administration reportedly has no current plans to replace the bpa s administrator . the entire northwest delegation ( democrats and republicans from the bpa region ) has asked that he be made the full - time administrator . however since many of the decision - makers at doe are conservative republicans they re not comfortable with him because he is a democrat . at this time doe people are unsure of how to handle this matter and appear to be in a state of limbo . dsi aluminum smelter - load reduction agreements : bpa is in the hot seat right now realizing that falling electricity prices is making it possible for smelters under load reduction agreements to begin shopping around for other sources . few believe that these current market prices will be sustainable considering the fact that the west will see a significant supply increase within the next year . consequently dsi s will be very concerned about signing long term price contracts given the current downward pressure on prices ( which are still historically very high but dropping ) . currently there are two northwest smelters seeking to restart plant operations . alcoa is in preliminary talks with bc hydro to secure additional power to restart its intalco smelter and kaiser free from the money and the constraints of a load - reduction agreement is also attempting to restart plants . we will continuing monitoring of this situation and will update as the story develops . bc hydro rate freeze : the current rate freeze was imposed by the former ndp government and it ends 30 september 2001 . it is up to the government to direct the bcuc to lift the rate freeze and before it can do that it has to schedule a rate hearing and decide to put the utility back",

                "Body": "executive summary ? several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the edison mou . ? a snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome . procedural scenarios assembly the assembly appropriations committee s plan to take up sb 78 xx today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full assembly on a party line vote . while the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of friday s draft bill it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend . if the problematic shaver lake provisions are removed from the bill assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill ( although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition ) . if the shaver lake amendments remain several central valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee . assembly speaker bob hertzberg supports this edison deal and the business community supports some recent amendments . this likely mitigates concerns from other pro - business democrats . with or without the shaver lake provisions hertzberg should get at least 41 democratic members ( and probably a few more ) but no more than 2 republicans ( if any ) to vote aye on the bill . hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass and there are 50 democrats in his caucus . if the vote is close a personal plea from him and or the governor should enable him to get to 41 . senate the bill would next move to the senate for approval of the assembly s amendments . this is where the prognosticating gets difficult . senate president pro tem john burton has said he does not support any amendments to sb 78 xx . gov . davis and speaker hertzberg will likely meet several times with burton to try to cut a deal but relations between davis and burton are currently frayed ( due to a variety of factors ) and burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position . this would lead to one of four scenarios : ? burton refuses to have the bill heard in the senate and no edison mou bill is approved before sept . 15 th ? burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition ( this option is unlikely ) ? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg and brings the bill ( as it is passed by the assembly ) for a vote in the full senate with his support ? burton comes to a deal with davis and hertzberg but as part of the deal he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the assembly for more amendments and another vote in the assembly - before a vote in the senate . john burton is considered one of the smartest and certainly the cleverest politician in california state government today so it is problematic to guess his next move . additionally external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result . for instance the governor may be willing to cut a deal with burton on an unrelated issue that burton cares more about resolving his way ( e . g . workers compensation benefits drug courts reapportionment ) . foretelling what will happen in the senate is extremely difficult . but davis and hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him and given burton s past actions he may string them along holding out for several days ( maybe even until sept . 14 th ) before he agrees to anything . governor assuming the bill escapes the senate ( and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes ) the governor will almost certainly sign it regardless of edison s public position . the bill will go into effect 90 days after the governor signs it . consumer groups have vowed to undo any edison bailout enacted into law by way of the ballot box . that could be either ( 1 ) an initiative to pass another bill overturning sb 78 xx and replacing it with other provisions or ( 2 ) a referendum to repeal sb 78 xx making it as if the bill was never passed at all . initiative once drafted and submitted to the attorney general it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary and another 25 days if the ag determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary . after either the 15 or 40 days the attorney general sends it to the proponents the senate the assembly and the secretary of state . the day it is mailed is called the summary date . that is the day upon which all calculations are made . the proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures . however the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters . therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election on march 5 2002 ( statewide primaries ) and so could not qualify until the statewide general election on november 5 2002 . however the window is tight for that election as well and a proposal would need to be submitted to the attorney general by the end of september 2001 to qualify for november 2002 . the legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative but cannot amend it . so whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot . an initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for governor in the preceding gubernatorial election ( 419",

                "Body": "executive summary : the likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60 % . this is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below but also because the 30 - day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week increasing the likelihood that their ipp creditors will act against them . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . 1 . utilities vs . cpuc governor davis attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed . the case will come before the judge on monday february 12 th . the federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities . however the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ( $ . 01 kwh ) . this will be left to an appellate court . the decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing by the smaller ipps ( as noted in our reports last week ) or by larger out - of - state generators such as duke reliant and dynegy ( as noted in the press this morning ) . this is expected next week or the week after . 2 . prospects for a bailout bill ab 18 x is effectively dead from lack of support . senator burton despite his public refusals is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail - out . the statements by burton and the ca state treasurer are merely a negotiating position . they are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear . for burton this is because of his long association with labor unions ; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy . burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate harvey rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him . the deal burton is expected to arrange would be for : bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state but with some kind of state support ( but less than full faith and credit of the state of ca which would not pass ) . this would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills ( e . g . $ . 01 though the actual amount is not known ) . these bonds would be asset - backed securities with payment receivable from rate payers . the term of these bonds is unknown ; if the term is made quite long ( e . g . 20 years ) the associated rate increase could be very small . the state would purchase the utilities transmission assets for a very high price . the amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled . if the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today ( which it is believed will happen ) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing ( or even the threat of one ) sources believe that this bail - out plan will be enacted quickly . as noted in an earlier report the california legislature habitually does not act until things hit the wall . it is expected that the republicans in the legislature will follow burton s lead and support the bail - out plan . the assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature . one moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail - out in her central valley district is 50 to 1 . however an involuntary filing ( or the threat thereof ) may be enough to trigger legislative support . it would allow the argument of an imminent threat to the people of the state of california . 3 . consumer opposition harvey rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum . if the referendum fails he intends to attack individual legislators ( though not john burton who reportedly has immunity from rosenfield ) . some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail - out plan then supporting a referendum from rosenfield later . however if the bail - out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill ( rather than put in place by the puc for example ) it cannot be reversed by a referendum . as additional insurance against rosenfield by supporting the bonds issued under the plan the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan . while it is not clear that this is a factual argument it still might impede any referendum",

presto kevin m . ; davis mark dana ; may tom ; will lloyd ; lindberg susan ; gupta gautam ; misra narsimha ; scheuer janelle ; baughman edward d . ; herndon rogers cc : nicolay christi l . subject : re : rto week - - summary of congestion management panel rto week day 2 - - october 16 2001 congestion management and transmission rights the morning panel discussion was on congestion management . the panelists were : nancy brockway commissioner new hampshire psc ; reem fahey edison mission ; carol guthrie chevron texaco ; shmuel oren university of california - berkley and advises texas puc ; andy ott pjm ; michael schnitzer northbridge group . general observations the commissioners were again all present ( wood left mid - morning to give testimony on capitol hill ) . today however ferc staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions . the topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again . this will probably continue for the rest of the week . what i have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts most notably the need for a real time energy market based using lmp . very few panelists have opposed this ; at most a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized - - basically conceding that pjm s system will be implemented in the northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else . locational marginal pricing the panelists all agreed that lmp in the real time market is necessary ( schmuel oren does not oppose it ) . most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across rtos . andy ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized . carol guthrie does not favor standardization and urged ferc to not standardize the pjm system throughout the eastern interconnect . she said ferc should try a couple of different systems and see what works . ftrs versus flowgates the panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial not physical . schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear . most of the panelists including the psc commissioner prefer ftrs rather than flowgates . schmuel is a flowgate advocate . after some discussion the panelists agreed that ftrs and flowgates could work together provided that the definition of flowgate is understood . andy ott said flowgates could work with ftrs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs ( liquidity standard product ) and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point - to - point rights then ftrs and flowgates can coexist . if a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights it s okay . however if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling the two cannot coexist . schmuel seemed to agree with this premise although this is not his preference . he seems to prefer only flowgates without ftrs . brockway seems to prefer ftrs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs . the panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from ftrs or flowgates should be allocated to load but the method of allocation was not agreed upon . ferc staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates . many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate and what happens when circumstances change over time resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant . schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable . the panelists agreed that these financial rights ( either ftrs or flowgates ) should be tradable in the secondary market . the panelists disagreed on which instrument - - ftrs or flowgates - - are more tradable . andy thinks ftrs are more tradable ; schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable . options versus obligations the panelists discussed the benefits of having ftrs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if ftrs are only options and the ftr holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow . andy ott said options will most likely result in fewer ftrs being allocated . schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front . the afternoon panel was on transmission planning and expansion . steve walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly . let me know if you have any questions . sara",

9558 e - mail : press to email summary with proprietary technology vspc is driving the growth of very large billion dollar new markets and is expected to generate very significant recurring income with patented technology products . to gain competitive advantage strategic partners are willing to integrate vspc s products on a worldwide basis . future vspc cost - effective growth is based on the fabless business model perfected by the semiconductor industry which for example outsources wafer manufacturing to the far east . strong management team a strong management team is the most important critical ingredient to creating future shareholder value . vspc has a strong management team ( see below ) . large rapidly growing markets in general to increase shareholder value a company must participate in rapidly growing markets and should try to be a significant player in targeted markets . vspc expects to dominate billion dollar markets that do not exist today by introducing believe it or not technology innovations that create and expand markets . breakthrough products in the vspc pipeline vpsc products in the process of commercialization are expected to enable up to 10 hours of laptop computer usage and three weeks of cell phone operation using fuel cells gps - free navigation especially for places where gps doesn t work ( a top dod priority ) automated analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x - ray imaging ( homeland security ) identification of narcotics chemicals and biological weapons . another total breakthrough with a nanotechnology based mass spectrometer is a portable carry - on suitcase size device that processes identifies one molecule at a time : further miniaturization is expected to shoebox size compared with stationary desk size provided by today s competitors . significant recurring income from fuel cell batteries in five years annual revenue from disposable fuel cartridges for fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices is expected to range between $ 7 billion on the low side to $ 45 billion on the high side . that market does not exist today . vspc s fuel cell cartridge business model is similar to the well - known razor razor blade model which is to sell the razor and then make much more money on the recurring blade business . the fuel cell is a razor and the disposable fuel cartridge is the razor blade . another analogy is the flashlight battery model . imagine if a company had the primary intellectual property involved in manufacturing flashlights . it would probably license that technology to major flashlight manufacturers in return for help in dominating the recurring flashlight battery business . in this case vspc has the proprietary rights to the flashlight - - the fuel cell - - and intends to sell the flashlight battery - - specifically disposable fuel cartridges for an end - user price of $ 2 - $ 3 each . vspc is currently negotiating to provide its patented fuel cell technology to major computer manufacturers in return for their agreement to use disposable fuel cartridges developed by vspc the manufacturing of which will be outsourced to well - known major plants in the far east . intellectual property protected with patents vspc s fuel cell technology for example is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . strategic partners lend credibility to create a cost - effective worldwide footprint emerging companies must partner with branded global companies who have strong management teams and significant resources . vspc is partnering with major well - known market leaders who have management resources and global branding . partners are attracted to vspc s technology and expect to gain competitive advantage by integrating patented proprietary technology obtained from vspc . for example in the fuel cell business toshiba nec sanyo hitachi and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . these companies are potential strategic partners for vspc . to better work with japanese manufacturers vspc has opened a tokyo office . fabless business model enables cost - effective growth fabless semiconductor chip companies design and develop proprietary chips then outsource manufacturing to wafer plants in the far east . some well - known fabless semiconductor companies ranked by market capitalization include $ 12 billion market cap broadcom ( brcm ) press here to view $ 11 billion market cap marvell semiconductor ( mrvl ) press here to view $ 9 billion market cap xilinx ( xlnx ) press here to view $ 7 . 3 billion market cap altera ( altr ) press here to view $ 4 . 5 billion market cap nvidia corp ( nvda ) press here to view $ 4 . 4 billion",
